## 1. Overview

### Definition and Purpose
- **Definition:**  
  The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. It allows classes to work together that otherwise couldn't because of incompatible interfaces.
- **Primary Goals:**  
  - **Interoperability:** Allow integration of classes with mismatched interfaces.
  - **Decoupling:** Separate the client from the specifics of the adapted classes.
  - **Reuse:** Enable reuse of existing classes without modifying their code.

### Types of Adapters
- **Object Adapter:**  
  Uses composition to wrap the adaptee. The adapter holds an instance of the class it adapts.
- **Class Adapter:**  
  Uses inheritance to adapt one interface to another. (Not common in C# because of its single inheritance constraint.)

## 2. How It Works Under the Hood

### Key Participants
- **Target Interface:**  
  The interface that the client expects.
- **Adaptee:**  
  The existing class with an incompatible interface.
- **Adapter:**  
  Implements the target interface and internally uses an instance of the adaptee to fulfill the client’s requests.

### Internal Mechanism
- **Delegation:**  
  The adapter translates client requests into calls on the adaptee. This often involves converting parameters, reordering method calls, or aggregating multiple calls.
- **Abstraction:**  
  The adapter hides the complexity and details of the adaptee, exposing a simplified interface to the client.
- **Flexibility:**  
  The use of composition (in an object adapter) means that the adapter can work with any subclass of the adaptee, increasing reusability.

## 3. C# Implementation Example

### Scenario: Integrating a Legacy Logging Library
Suppose you have a legacy logging class that writes logs in a format not compatible with your current application. The legacy class has a method `WriteLog(string message)`, but your application expects an interface `ILogger` with a method `Log(string message)`.

### Legacy Logger (Adaptee)
```typescript
// Legacy logger with an incompatible interface.
public class LegacyLogger
{
    public void WriteLog(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Legacy Log: {message}");
    }
}
```

**Target Interface**
```typescript
// The interface that the client code expects.
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
}
```
**Adapter Implementation (Object Adapter)**
```typescript
// The adapter implements the ILogger interface and wraps the LegacyLogger.
public class LoggerAdapter : ILogger
{
    private readonly LegacyLogger _legacyLogger;

    public LoggerAdapter(LegacyLogger legacyLogger)
    {
        _legacyLogger = legacyLogger;
    }

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        // Delegates the call to the legacy logger's WriteLog method.
        _legacyLogger.WriteLog(message);
    }
}
```

**Client Code Usage**
```typescript
public class Application
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public Application(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void Run()
    {
        _logger.Log("Application started.");
    }
}

// Usage example:
LegacyLogger legacyLogger = new LegacyLogger();
ILogger logger = new LoggerAdapter(legacyLogger);
Application app = new Application(logger);
app.Run();
// Output: Legacy Log: Application started.
```

**4. Real-World Use Cases
Integrating Third-Party Libraries
Scenario:**
When using a third-party library that doesn't conform to your system's interfaces, an adapter can be created to wrap the third-party code, making it compatible with your application's design.

**Benefit:**
This allows seamless integration without modifying the external library.

**UI Component Integration
Scenario:**
Adapting a legacy UI component that exposes a different event model or property set than the modern framework you are using.

**Benefit:**
The adapter can translate calls and events, allowing the legacy component to work within the new UI framework.

**Data Format Conversion
Scenario:**
When dealing with external systems that output data in a format that differs from your application's expected format, an adapter can convert the data on the fly.

**Benefit:**
Provides a clean separation between data parsing and business logic.

**5. Design Considerations and Best Practices
Use Composition Over Inheritance
Why:**
In C#, composition is generally preferred because the language supports single inheritance only. An object adapter using composition is more flexible and can work with various subclasses of the adaptee.

**Minimize Coupling
Encapsulation:**
The adapter should encapsulate all details of the adaptee. The client should be unaware of the underlying legacy or external system.

**Interface Contracts:**
Ensure that the adapter fully adheres to the target interface so that client code can remain agnostic to the adapter’s internal workings.

**Testability
Unit Testing:**
The adapter pattern makes unit testing easier by allowing you to substitute a mock or stub in place of the concrete adaptee, verifying that the adapter correctly translates calls.

**Performance
Overhead Consideration:**
While the adapter introduces a small overhead due to delegation, it is generally negligible compared to the benefits of decoupling and flexibility.

**6. Abstract Examples in .NET
Usage in the .NET Framework
System.IO.Stream Adapters:**
The .NET Framework uses adapter-like patterns to wrap various stream implementations (e.g., FileStream, MemoryStream) under the common Stream abstract class, allowing uniform handling of different data sources.

**Data Provider Factories:**
ADO.NET uses factory patterns to abstract database connectivity, where different concrete implementations (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) are adapted to a common interface.
**
Best Practices for Interview Discussions
Explain the Problem Domain:**
Clearly describe a scenario where an adapter is beneficial (e.g., integrating a legacy system).

**Discuss Trade-Offs:**
Mention the trade-offs such as additional indirection vs. the benefit of decoupling.

**Highlight Real-World Implementations:**
Reference examples from the .NET Framework (like stream adapters) to demonstrate a deep understanding of how adapters are used in large-scale systems.
