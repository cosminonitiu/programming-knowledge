Anonymous methods and lambda expressions in C# allow you to define inline functions without having to declare a separate method. They provide a concise and flexible way to create delegates, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## 1. Anonymous Methods

### **Definition:**
- Anonymous methods enable you to write inline code blocks that can be assigned to delegate types without explicitly naming the method.

### **Syntax Example:**
```typescript
public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

public class AnonymousMethodExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Define an anonymous method and assign it to a delegate
        MyDelegate del = delegate(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Anonymous method says: " + message);
        };

        // Invoke the delegate
        del("Hello, Anonymous Methods!");
    }
}
```

**Key Points:
Inline Definition:**
The code block is defined at the point where the delegate is assigned.

**Type Inference:**
The parameter type is explicitly stated in this example, but can sometimes be inferred.

**Usage:**
Useful for short, simple operations that don't require reuse elsewhere.

**2. Lambda Expressions
Definition:**
Lambda expressions provide a more concise syntax to define anonymous functions. They are essentially a shorthand for writing anonymous methods.

**Syntax Example:**
```typescript
public delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

public class LambdaExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Define a lambda expression and assign it to a delegate
        MyDelegate del = (message) => 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Lambda expression says: " + message);
        };

        // Invoke the delegate
        del("Hello, Lambda Expressions!");
    }
}
```

**Simplified Lambda:**
For single statements, the braces and the return keyword can be omitted:

```typescript
MyDelegate del = message => Console.WriteLine("Lambda says: " + message);
del("Simplified Lambda!");
```

**Key Points:
Concise Syntax:**
Lambda expressions reduce boilerplate and make the code easier to read.

**Parameter Inference:**
In many cases, the compiler can infer the parameter types, so you donâ€™t need to specify them.

**Use with LINQ:**
Lambdas are widely used in LINQ queries to express predicates and transformations.

**3. Comparison and Use Cases
Anonymous Methods vs. Lambda Expressions:
Anonymous Methods:**

**Introduced in C# 2.0.**

Slightly more verbose syntax.

Allows for more flexible declaration of parameters (including omitting parameters entirely).

**Lambda Expressions:

Introduced in C# 3.0.**

More concise and expressive.

Better support in LINQ and functional programming scenarios.

**When to Use:
Anonymous Methods:**
Use when you need a simple inline method and when you want to omit parameters entirely.

**Lambda Expressions:**
Preferred for most scenarios due to their brevity and clarity, especially in LINQ queries or when chaining multiple operations.
