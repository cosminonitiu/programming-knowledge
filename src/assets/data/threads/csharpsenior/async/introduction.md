The async and await keywords in C# are used to simplify asynchronous programming, allowing you to write non-blocking code that can improve the responsiveness and scalability of your applications. They are particularly useful for I/O-bound operations but can also be used for CPU-bound operations with some considerations. This feature allows developers to perform non-blocking operations without the complex code traditionally associated with asynchronous programming, such as callbacks or manual thread management

**1. What are async and await?**
async: A keyword used to mark a method as asynchronous. It enables the use of await inside the method.
await: A keyword used to pause the execution of an asynchronous method until the awaited task completes. It does not block the thread.

**2. How async and await Work**
When an async method is called, it runs synchronously until it encounters an await expression.
The await expression pauses the method and returns control to the caller, allowing the thread to perform other work.
When the awaited task completes, the method resumes execution from where it left off.

**Under the Hood**
The compiler transforms async methods into a state machine, allowing them to pause and resume execution.
await uses the Task or Task<T> type to represent asynchronous operations.

**3. async and await vs Threads and Processes
a. Threads**
Threads: A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently.

Relation to async/await:
async/await does not create new threads by default. It leverages the existing thread pool and asynchronous I/O operations.
For I/O-bound operations (e.g., file I/O, network requests), async/await uses non-blocking I/O, freeing up threads to perform other work.
For CPU-bound operations, async/await can use threads from the thread pool to run tasks concurrently.

**b. Processes**
Processes: A process is an instance of a running program with its own memory space.

Relation to async/await:
async/await operates within a single process. It does not directly interact with other processes.
Inter-process communication (e.g., using pipes or sockets) can be made asynchronous using async/await.

**4. I/O-Bound vs CPU-Bound Operations
a. I/O-Bound Operations**
Definition: Operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output (e.g., file I/O, network requests, database queries).

How async/await Helps:
Uses non-blocking I/O, allowing the thread to perform other work while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
Improves scalability by reducing the number of threads blocked on I/O.

**b. CPU-Bound Operations**
Definition: Operations that spend most of their time performing computations (e.g., mathematical calculations, image processing).

How async/await Helps:
Uses threads from the thread pool to run tasks concurrently.
Improves responsiveness by offloading CPU-bound work to background threads.
