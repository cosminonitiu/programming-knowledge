**Clean Architecture** is an architectural pattern that separates the concerns of different parts of an application. It aims to make systems more maintainable and scalable by clearly separating different layers, such as business logic, data access, and user interfaces.

The main goal is to create systems that are **independent of frameworks, UI, database, and external agencies**. Clean Architecture ensures that the core business logic is isolated from technical concerns, making the system easier to test, maintain, and extend.

### **Core Layers of Clean Architecture**:

- **Entities**: The core business objects or models that represent the domain.
- **Use Cases (Interactors)**: Contains the business logic and application-specific rules. This is where the main functionality resides.
- **Interface Adapters**: Adapts data from the use cases and entities to and from the external systems (UI, API, etc.). For example, MVC or API controllers, data transfer objects (DTOs), and repositories.
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: The outermost layer containing frameworks, databases, UI, and APIs. This layer interacts with the rest of the system via interfaces defined in the core layers.

The overall direction is from the top (Presentation) to the bottom (Core). Higher layers depend on lower layers, but lower layers must remain independent of the higher ones. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and helps avoid circular dependencies.

This structure aligns well with the Dependency Inversion Principle: high-level modules (like the BLL) depend on abstractions defined in the Core, while the lower-level modules (like the DAL) implement these abstractions without introducing a dependency on higher layers.

### **Example of Clean Architecture in .NET**:

```

Copy code
+---------------------------------+
|    Frameworks & Drivers         |  (UI, Database, API Controllers)
+---------------------------------+
|    Interface Adapters           |  (DTOs, API Models, Repositories)
+---------------------------------+
|    Application Use Cases        |  (Business Logic)
+---------------------------------+
|    Entities                     |  (Core Business Models)
+---------------------------------+

```

- **Core business logic** is located in the innermost layer (`Entities` and `Use Cases`), while external components like databases or web frameworks (e.g., ASP.NET Core) reside in the outermost layer.
- Dependencies should only flow **inward**: Frameworks and external concerns should not affect core business logic.
- **Testing** becomes easier because business logic is decoupled from external infrastructure, making unit tests more isolated.
