## 1. Definitions

### Swallowing Exceptions
- **Definition:**  
  Swallowing an exception means catching it and then not rethrowing it, effectively preventing the exception from propagating further up the call stack.
- **Implications:**  
  The error is handled locally, and control continues as if no exception occurred. While this might be acceptable in some cases (e.g., logging a non-critical error), it can also lead to hidden bugs if errors are silently ignored.

### Propagating Exceptions
- **Definition:**  
  Propagating an exception means catching it to perform necessary tasks (such as logging or cleanup) and then rethrowing it (or not catching it at all) so that higher-level components can handle it.
- **Implications:**  
  This approach ensures that the error is visible to the calling code or global exception handlers, preserving the stack trace and context for debugging.

## 2. When to Swallow Exceptions

### Acceptable Scenarios
- **Non-Critical Operations:**  
  In scenarios where the error does not impact the overall operation of the application and a default or fallback behavior is acceptable.
- **Logging or Cleanup Only:**  
  When the only goal is to log the error or perform cleanup, and the application can safely continue without further handling.
  
### Risks
- **Hidden Bugs:**  
  Swallowing exceptions can hide underlying issues that might cause larger problems later on.
- **Inconsistent Application State:**  
  If an exception is swallowed, parts of the system might continue running with incomplete or incorrect state.
  
### Example (Swallowing with Logging)
```typescript
try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception.
    ProcessOptionalTask();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception but do not rethrow it.
    Logger.Log("Optional task failed: " + ex.Message);
    // Continue without propagating the exception.
}
```

**3. When to Propagate Exceptions
Acceptable Scenarios
Critical Failures:**
When an error indicates a critical failure that must be handled at a higher level to ensure the system's integrity.

**Unrecoverable Errors:**
When the exception signals that the current operation cannot proceed safely, and it should be escalated.

**Maintaining Traceability:**
Propagating exceptions preserves the full stack trace, which is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues.

**Best Practice: Rethrowing Exceptions
Preserve the Stack Trace:**
Use throw; without specifying the exception variable to rethrow the original exception while maintaining its stack trace.

Example (Propagating with Logging and Cleanup)
```typescript
try
{
    // Code that might throw an exception.
    ProcessCriticalOperation();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the error for diagnostic purposes.
    Logger.Log("Critical error encountered: " + ex.Message);
    // Optionally perform cleanup or rollback operations here.
    
    // Rethrow the exception to propagate it upward.
    throw;
}
```
