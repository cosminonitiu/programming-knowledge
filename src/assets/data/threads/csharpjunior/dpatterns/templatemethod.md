## 1. Overview

### Definition and Purpose
- **Definition:**  
  The Template Method Pattern defines a method (the "template method") in an abstract class that outlines the steps of an algorithm. Some of these steps are implemented in the abstract class (or even as default behavior), while others are declared as abstract or virtual methods to be implemented by subclasses.
- **Purpose:**  
  - **Enforce a Workflow:**  
    Guarantee that certain steps of an algorithm are executed in a specific order.
  - **Allow Customization:**  
    Enable subclasses to customize or extend parts of the algorithm without altering its structure.
  - **Promote Code Reuse:**  
    Share common code in the base class while still allowing variation in behavior for different contexts.

## 2. How It Works Under the Hood

### Key Components
- **Abstract Class (Template):**  
  Contains the template method that defines the overall algorithm and includes calls to abstract or virtual methods representing the steps.
- **Concrete Subclasses:**  
  Override the abstract or virtual methods to provide specific implementations for the steps that vary.
  
### Internal Mechanics
- **Fixed Skeleton:**  
  The template method, defined in the abstract class, encapsulates the invariant parts of the algorithm. This method calls one or more abstract or hook methods.
- **Method Overriding (Dynamic Binding):**  
  Subclasses implement or override these abstract or virtual methods. At runtime, when the template method is executed, the overridden methods are invoked, enabling customized behavior.
- **Control Flow:**  
  The control flow of the algorithm is managed by the template method, ensuring that even if subclasses provide different implementations, the overall sequence remains consistent.

## 3. Real-World Use Cases

### Example 1: Data Processing Pipelines
- **Scenario:**  
  Consider a data processing framework where data must be validated, transformed, and then stored. While the overall pipeline (validate → transform → store) is fixed, the specific validation rules, transformation logic, or storage mechanisms may vary between different implementations.
- **Application:**  
  An abstract class defines the pipeline and declares abstract methods for each step. Concrete classes implement these methods according to specific requirements (e.g., processing CSV files vs. JSON files).

### Example 2: UI Framework Rendering
- **Scenario:**  
  In a UI framework, rendering a component might involve a series of steps such as setting up the environment, drawing the component, and cleaning up. While the overall rendering process is constant, each component might render differently.
- **Application:**  
  An abstract renderer class defines the template method for rendering, while each UI component subclass overrides the drawing step to render its unique appearance.

### Example 3: Game Development
- **Scenario:**  
  In a game, different types of characters might follow a common behavior sequence (e.g., initialize, update, render, and cleanup). However, each character type might have specific logic for these phases.
- **Application:**  
  A game engine can use the Template Method Pattern to standardize the game loop while allowing character-specific behavior through subclass implementations.

## 4. C# Implementation Example

### Abstract Class with Template Method
```typescript
public abstract class DataProcessor
{
    // Template method defining the skeleton of the algorithm.
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        LoadData();
        ValidateData();
        TransformData();
        SaveData();
    }

    // Concrete step with a default implementation (optional).
    protected virtual void LoadData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Loading data from source...");
    }

    // Steps that must be implemented by subclasses.
    protected abstract void ValidateData();
    protected abstract void TransformData();

    // Hook method with a default implementation that can be overridden.
    protected virtual void SaveData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Saving data to destination...");
    }
}
```

Concrete Subclass Implementations
```typescript
public class CsvDataProcessor : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ValidateData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Validating CSV data...");
        // CSV-specific validation logic.
    }

    protected override void TransformData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Transforming CSV data...");
        // CSV-specific transformation logic.
    }
}

public class JsonDataProcessor : DataProcessor
{
    protected override void ValidateData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Validating JSON data...");
        // JSON-specific validation logic.
    }

    protected override void TransformData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Transforming JSON data...");
        // JSON-specific transformation logic.
    }

    // Optionally override SaveData if JSON storage differs.
    protected override void SaveData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Saving JSON data...");
    }
}
```

**Client Code Usage**
```typescript
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        DataProcessor csvProcessor = new CsvDataProcessor();
        Console.WriteLine("Processing CSV Data:");
        csvProcessor.ProcessData();
        
        Console.WriteLine();

        DataProcessor jsonProcessor = new JsonDataProcessor();
        Console.WriteLine("Processing JSON Data:");
        jsonProcessor.ProcessData();
    }
}
```
**Expected Output:**
```kotlin
Processing CSV Data:
Loading data from source...
Validating CSV data...
Transforming CSV data...
Saving data to destination...

Processing JSON Data:
Loading data from source...
Validating JSON data...
Transforming JSON data...
Saving JSON data...
```

**5. Best Practices and Interview Tips
Best Practices
Keep the Template Method Final:**
Mark the template method as sealed if you want to prevent further overrides, ensuring that the algorithm’s structure remains unchanged.

**Minimize Coupling:**
Ensure that the abstract class only defines the overall process and does not depend on concrete implementations.

**Provide Default Implementations:**
Use virtual methods for steps that might have a default behavior, allowing subclasses to override them only if needed.

**Document the Template:**
Clearly document the sequence of operations and the expected behavior of each step.

**Interview Tips
Explain the Pattern's Benefits:**
Be prepared to discuss how the Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse and enforces a standard process while allowing flexibility for subclass-specific behavior.

**Discuss Real-World Scenarios:**
Provide examples such as data processing pipelines or game loops where the pattern is particularly useful.

**Highlight Trade-Offs:**
Mention that while the pattern enforces a fixed algorithm structure, it can reduce flexibility if too rigidly applied.

**Integration with Other Patterns:**
Explain how the Template Method Pattern can work in conjunction with patterns like Strategy (for interchangeable algorithm steps) or Factory (for creating concrete processors).
