Working with large datasets requires careful design to ensure efficient data retrieval and minimal memory overhead. EF Core offers several techniques to handle such scenarios, including pagination, streaming, and performance tuning. Below, we cover strategies for efficient data retrieval and memory management in high-load environments.

## 1. Pagination, Streaming Data, and Efficient Data Retrieval

### **Pagination**
- **Purpose:**  
  Pagination helps by loading only a subset of records at a time, reducing memory consumption and improving response times.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Skip/Take Pattern:**  
    Use LINQ’s `Skip()` and `Take()` operators to fetch a specific page of results.
```typescript
    int pageNumber = 2;
    int pageSize = 50;
    var pagedProducts = context.Products
                               .OrderBy(p => p.ProductId)
                               .Skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize)
                               .Take(pageSize)
                               .ToList();
```
  - **Keyset Pagination:**  
    For large datasets where offset pagination becomes inefficient, keyset pagination (also known as the "seek method") uses a key value (like an ID) to retrieve the next set of results.
```typescript
    int lastSeenId = 100;
    var pagedProducts = context.Products
                               .Where(p => p.ProductId > lastSeenId)
                               .OrderBy(p => p.ProductId)
                               .Take(pageSize)
                               .ToList();
```

### **Streaming Data**
- **Purpose:**  
  Streaming allows you to process large result sets incrementally rather than loading everything into memory at once.
- **EF Core Support:**  
  While EF Core doesn’t natively support streaming like some ORMs, you can use techniques like `AsAsyncEnumerable()` to process data item by item.
  ```typescript
  await foreach (var product in context.Products.AsAsyncEnumerable())
  {
      // Process each product without holding the entire dataset in memory.
      Console.WriteLine(product.Name);
  }
  ```

**Efficient Data Retrieval
Projection:**
Retrieve only the columns you need using LINQ projections. This reduces the amount of data transferred from the database.

```typescript
var productSummaries = context.Products
                              .Where(p => p.Price > 100)
                              .Select(p => new { p.ProductId, p.Name, p.Price })
                              .ToList();
```
**Split Queries:**
When working with complex object graphs, use AsSplitQuery() to prevent Cartesian explosion and improve performance.

```typescript
var orders = context.Orders
                    .Include(o => o.OrderDetails)
                    .AsSplitQuery()
                    .ToList();
```

**2. Memory Management and Performance Tuning in High-Load Scenarios
Memory Management
No-Tracking Queries:**
For read-only operations, disable change tracking to reduce memory usage.

```typescript
var products = context.Products
                      .AsNoTracking()
                      .ToList();
```
**Limiting Loaded Data:**
Always project to DTOs or anonymous types if you don’t need the full entity, minimizing the memory footprint.

**Dispose of DbContext Promptly:**
Use short-lived DbContext instances to ensure that memory used for tracking entities is released promptly after use.

**Performance Tuning
Batching Operations:**
Use batch processing for insert, update, or delete operations to minimize the number of round trips to the database.

**Compiled Queries:**
For frequently executed queries, use EF.CompileQuery to cache the query plan.

```typescript
var compiledQuery = EF.CompileQuery((AppDbContext ctx, decimal minPrice) =>
    ctx.Products.Where(p => p.Price > minPrice));
var productsAbovePrice = compiledQuery(context, 100);
```
**Indexing and Query Optimization:**
Ensure that your database tables are properly indexed based on your query patterns. Use SQL logging to review and optimize generated SQL queries.

**Monitoring and Profiling:**
Integrate profiling tools such as Application Insights, SQL Profiler, or EF Core’s diagnostic logging to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

**Handling Concurrency:**
In high-load scenarios, implement concurrency strategies (optimistic or pessimistic) and use transaction scopes judiciously to balance data consistency with performance.
