## 1. Overview

### Repository Pattern
- **Definition:**  
  The Repository Pattern abstracts the data layer by providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. This encapsulates data access logic, hiding details of the underlying persistence mechanism.
- **Goals:**  
  - **Decoupling:** Isolate business logic from data access code.
  - **Simplification:** Offer a consistent API (e.g., `GetById()`, `Add()`, `Remove()`) for performing data operations.
  - **Testability:** Facilitate unit testing by enabling the use of mock repositories.

### Unit of Work Pattern
- **Definition:**  
  The Unit of Work Pattern manages a set of operations (inserts, updates, deletes) within a business transaction. It tracks changes to entities and coordinates their persistence, ensuring that either all changes are committed or none are.
- **Goals:**  
  - **Transactional Integrity:** Ensure that all changes in a transaction are saved together.
  - **Coordination:** Manage multiple repository operations within a single transaction.
  - **Consistency:** Provide a single point of commit for all operations, preventing partial updates.

## 2. Internal Workings

### Repository Pattern Internals
- **Abstraction of Data Access:**  
  The repository provides methods to query and persist data without exposing the underlying ORM (e.g., Entity Framework) or database details.
- **Common Methods:**  
  - `GetById(int id)`: Retrieve a single entity.
  - `GetAll()`: Retrieve all entities.
  - `Add(T entity)`: Insert a new entity.
  - `Remove(T entity)`: Delete an entity.
- **Example:**  
  A generic repository may wrap a `DbSet<T>` from Entity Framework:
  ```typescript
  public class Repository<T> : IRepository<T> where T : class
  {
      protected readonly DbContext _context;
      protected readonly DbSet<T> _dbSet;
      
      public Repository(DbContext context)
      {
          _context = context;
          _dbSet = _context.Set<T>();
      }
      
      public T GetById(int id) => _dbSet.Find(id);
      
      public IEnumerable<T> GetAll() => _dbSet.ToList();
      
      public void Add(T entity) => _dbSet.Add(entity);
      
      public void Remove(T entity) => _dbSet.Remove(entity);
  }
  ```

  **Unit of Work Pattern Internals
Change Tracking:**
The Unit of Work tracks changes to the entities that repositories work with, typically via the ORMâ€™s built-in change tracker.

**Transactional Boundaries:**
It provides a Complete() method (or SaveChanges()) that commits all pending changes as a single transaction.

**Coordination of Repositories:**
The Unit of Work aggregates multiple repositories, ensuring that operations on different types are coordinated.

Example:
A Unit of Work wrapping an Entity Framework context:

```typescript
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IRepository<Customer> Customers { get; }
    IRepository<Order> Orders { get; }
    int Complete();
}

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    public IRepository<Customer> Customers { get; private set; }
    public IRepository<Order> Orders { get; private set; }
    
    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
        Customers = new Repository<Customer>(_context);
        Orders = new Repository<Order>(_context);
    }
    
    public int Complete() => _context.SaveChanges();
    
    public void Dispose() => _context.Dispose();
}
```

**3. Real-World Use Cases
Enterprise Applications**
Scenario:
In an e-commerce system, actions like placing an order require updates to multiple entities (customers, orders, inventory). The Unit of Work ensures these changes are committed together.

Benefit:
Improves consistency and prevents data corruption from partial updates.

**Microservices Architecture**
Scenario:
Each microservice manages its own data access layer. Using the Repository and Unit of Work patterns allows each service to abstract database interactions and manage transactions efficiently.

Benefit:
Promotes modularity and simplifies testing by decoupling business logic from data persistence.

**Legacy Systems Integration**
Scenario:
When modernizing legacy systems, wrapping the data access layer in repositories can provide a uniform API and facilitate gradual migration to newer ORM technologies.

Benefit:
Reduces the risk of breaking changes and makes unit testing more straightforward.

**4. Best Practices
Repository Pattern
Single Responsibility:**
Ensure repositories focus solely on data access, leaving business logic to services or controllers.

**Interface-Based Design:**
Define repository interfaces (e.g., IRepository<T>) to allow for easy mocking and testing.

**Avoid Over-Generic Repositories:**
Sometimes specialized repositories for specific entities or aggregate roots provide clearer and more maintainable abstractions.

**Unit of Work Pattern
Encapsulate Transaction Boundaries:**
Use the Unit of Work to ensure that multiple operations across repositories commit as a single transaction.

**Dependency Injection:**
Integrate the Unit of Work with a DI container to manage the lifecycle of the DbContext or data access layer.

**Error Handling:**
Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms to maintain data integrity if a transaction fails.
**
Testing:**
Use dependency injection and mocking frameworks to test business logic without relying on an actual database.

**5. Interview Tips
Concept Explanation:**
Be ready to explain the core principles of the Repository and Unit of Work patterns and how they promote loose coupling and separation of concerns.

**Real-World Examples:**
Discuss scenarios such as order processing in e-commerce systems or microservices handling distributed transactions.

**Implementation Details:**
Explain how you would implement these patterns using an ORM like Entity Framework, and mention potential challenges (e.g., managing DbContext lifetimes, ensuring transactional consistency).

**Trade-Offs:**
Address trade-offs like the added abstraction layers and complexity versus the benefits of maintainability and testability.

**Integration with DI:**
Mention how these patterns integrate with dependency injection to create a clean and modular architecture.
