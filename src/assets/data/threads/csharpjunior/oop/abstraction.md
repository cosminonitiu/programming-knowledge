**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system. It allows focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it. In .NET, abstraction is achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and can have both fully implemented methods (concrete methods) and abstract methods (methods without implementation).
- **Interface**: A contract that defines a set of methods but does not provide any implementation.

### **Key Concepts of Abstraction:**

- **Abstract Class**: A class that provides a common base for other classes but cannot be instantiated on its own.
- **Interface**: A collection of abstract methods that a class can implement, ensuring that the class provides implementations for those methods.

### **Example of Abstraction in .NET (Abstract Class):**

```typescript
// Abstract class
public abstract class Shape
{
    // Abstract method (doesn't have a body)
    public abstract void Draw();

    // Regular method with implementation
    public void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Shape is moving.");
    }
}

// Derived class
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()  // Implementing the abstract method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Circle.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Shape shape = new Circle();  // Cannot instantiate Shape directly
        shape.Draw();                 // Output: Drawing a Circle.
        shape.Move();                 // Output: Shape is moving.
    }
}

```

In this example:

- The class `Shape` is abstract and contains both an abstract method (`Draw`) and a concrete method (`Move`).
- The class `Circle` derives from `Shape` and implements the abstract `Draw` method.
- You cannot instantiate an abstract class directly; instead, you must instantiate a derived class that provides implementations for abstract methods.

### **Example of Abstraction in .NET (Interface):**

```typescript
// Interface
public interface IDrawable
{
    void Draw();  // Method signature without implementation
}

// Class implementing the interface
public class Rectangle : IDrawable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Rectangle.");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IDrawable drawable = new Rectangle();
        drawable.Draw();  // Output: Drawing a Rectangle.
    }
}

```

In this example:

- `IDrawable` is an interface with a method `Draw()`, which is implemented by the `Rectangle` class.
- The `Rectangle` class provides the actual implementation for the `Draw` method.
- Interfaces allow different classes to implement the same set of methods but with different implementations.

**3. Advanced Abstraction Techniques
Combining Abstract Classes and Interfaces
Scenario:**
You might design a system where an abstract class provides common functionality and implements one or more interfaces to guarantee that derived classes adhere to certain contracts.

Example:

```typescript
public interface ISerializable
{
    string Serialize();
}

public abstract class Document : ISerializable
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    
    // Abstract method to be implemented by derived classes
    public abstract void Print();
    
    // Common implementation for serialization
    public virtual string Serialize()
    {
        return $"Document: {Title}";
    }
}

public class Report : Document
{
    public override void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Printing report: {Title}");
    }
    
    public override string Serialize()
    {
        // Custom serialization logic for a report
        return $"Report: {Title}";
    }
}
```

**Default Interface Methods (C# 8.0+)
Purpose:**
Allow interfaces to provide a default implementation for some of its members, reducing the need to modify every implementation when extending interfaces.

Example:

```typescript
public interface ILogger
{
    void Log(string message);
    
    // Default method implementation
    void LogError(string error)
    {
        Log($"ERROR: {error}");
    }
}

public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
{
    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
    
    // Inherits default LogError implementation from ILogger
}
```

**Using Generics for Abstraction
Concept:**
Generics allow you to write abstract, type-safe classes and methods that work with any data type.

Example:

```typescript
public abstract class Repository<T>
{
    public abstract void Add(T item);
    public abstract T Get(int id);
    
    // Concrete generic method
    public void PrintItem(T item)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(item.ToString());
    }
}

public class CustomerRepository : Repository<Customer>
{
    public override void Add(Customer item)
    {
        // Implementation to add a customer
    }
    
    public override Customer Get(int id)
    {
        // Implementation to retrieve a customer
        return new Customer();
    }
}
```

**Common Interview Topics:
Difference Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces:**
Be prepared to discuss when to use one over the other, including the impact on design, flexibility, and multiple inheritance.

**Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding:**
Explain how abstraction enables polymorphism and how C# resolves method calls at runtime using virtual method tables.

**Design Patterns Utilizing Abstraction:**
Discuss patterns like the Strategy, Template Method, and Factory patterns that leverage abstraction to promote code reuse and flexibility.

**Default Interface Methods:**
Understand the benefits and potential pitfalls introduced with default implementations in interfaces (C# 8.0+).
**
Practical Examples:**
Be ready to write or analyze code that demonstrates abstraction in action, focusing on clear separation of concerns and maintainable design.
