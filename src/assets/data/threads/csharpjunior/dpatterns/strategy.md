## 1. Overview

### Definition and Purpose
- **Definition:**  
  The Strategy Pattern defines a common interface for a group of algorithms and allows the client to select the appropriate algorithm at runtime without changing the client’s code.
- **Primary Goals:**  
  - **Decoupling:** Separates the implementation of an algorithm from the code that uses it.
  - **Interchangeability:** Enables switching algorithms dynamically based on context or user input.
  - **Maintainability:** Simplifies code maintenance by isolating different algorithm implementations into separate classes.

## 2. How It Works Under the Hood

### Key Participants
- **Strategy Interface:**  
  Declares a common interface for all supported algorithms. This interface defines the method(s) that all concrete strategies must implement.
- **Concrete Strategies:**  
  Implement the strategy interface with specific algorithm implementations. Each concrete strategy encapsulates a particular behavior.
- **Context:**  
  Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithmic work to the current strategy. The context allows for the strategy to be changed at runtime.

### Internal Mechanism
- **Encapsulation of Algorithms:**  
  Each concrete strategy encapsulates a specific algorithm independently. This encapsulation allows for a clear separation of concerns.
- **Dynamic Binding:**  
  The context relies on dynamic binding to call the strategy’s methods. The actual method executed is determined at runtime based on which strategy object is currently set.
- **Interchangeability:**  
  Because all strategies implement the same interface, the context can switch between them without needing to know the details of each algorithm.

## 3. Real-World Use Cases

### Example: Sorting Algorithms
- **Scenario:**  
  An application might need to sort data using different algorithms based on dataset size or characteristics. The Strategy Pattern can encapsulate multiple sorting strategies (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort) and let the client select one dynamically.

### Example: Payment Processing
- **Scenario:**  
  In an e-commerce system, different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency) require different processing algorithms. By encapsulating each payment method as a strategy, the system can dynamically choose the appropriate method based on user preference.

### Example: Logging and Formatting
- **Scenario:**  
  A logging framework may need to support different logging formats (plain text, JSON, XML). Each format can be implemented as a strategy, allowing the framework to switch formats at runtime.

## 4. C# Implementation Example

### Strategy Interface and Concrete Strategies
```typescript
// Strategy Interface
public interface ICompressionStrategy
{
    void Compress(string fileName);
}

// Concrete Strategy: ZIP Compression
public class ZipCompressionStrategy : ICompressionStrategy
{
    public void Compress(string fileName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Compressing {fileName} using ZIP compression.");
    }
}

// Concrete Strategy: RAR Compression
public class RarCompressionStrategy : ICompressionStrategy
{
    public void Compress(string fileName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Compressing {fileName} using RAR compression.");
    }
}
```

**Context Class**
```typescript
public class CompressionContext
{
    private ICompressionStrategy _compressionStrategy;

    // Allows dynamic change of the compression strategy
    public void SetStrategy(ICompressionStrategy strategy)
    {
        _compressionStrategy = strategy;
    }

    public void CompressFile(string fileName)
    {
        if (_compressionStrategy == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Compression strategy not set.");
        }
        _compressionStrategy.Compress(fileName);
    }
}
```
**Client Code**
```typescript
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var context = new CompressionContext();

        // Use ZIP compression strategy
        context.SetStrategy(new ZipCompressionStrategy());
        context.CompressFile("example.txt");

        // Switch to RAR compression strategy at runtime
        context.SetStrategy(new RarCompressionStrategy());
        context.CompressFile("example.txt");
    }
}
```

**5. Best Practices and Interview Tips
Best Practices
Interface Consistency:**
Define a clear and minimal strategy interface that all concrete strategies implement.

**Context Flexibility:**
Allow the context to change strategies dynamically if needed. This is particularly useful in systems where conditions or requirements change at runtime.

**Encapsulation:**
Keep algorithm implementations encapsulated in separate classes to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Decoupling:**
Ensure that the context does not depend on concrete implementations. The context should only interact with the strategy interface.

**Interview Tips
Explain the Benefits:**
Emphasize how the Strategy Pattern promotes loose coupling and flexibility by allowing algorithms to be swapped at runtime.

**Discuss Real-World Scenarios:**
Be prepared to describe real-world applications like payment processing or file compression where the Strategy Pattern enhances design.

**Compare with Other Patterns:**
Understand and explain differences between the Strategy Pattern and other behavioral patterns, such as the State Pattern, which may appear similar at a glance.

**Deep Dive into Implementation Details:**
Be ready to discuss the role of dynamic binding, encapsulation of algorithm-specific code, and how dependency injection can further improve the pattern's flexibility and testability.
