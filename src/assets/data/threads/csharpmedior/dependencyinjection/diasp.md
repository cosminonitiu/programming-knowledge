ASP.NET Core has dependency injection (DI) built into its core framework, making it a first-class citizen in the design of modern web applications. The built-in DI container is lightweight yet powerful, enabling developers to manage service lifetimes, resolve dependencies automatically, and promote loose coupling and testability across the application.

## 1. Core Concepts

### What is Dependency Injection?
- **Definition:**  
  Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows an objectâ€™s dependencies to be provided (or "injected") from an external source rather than the object creating them itself. This enables better modularity, testability, and easier maintenance.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
- **Relationship to DI:**  
  DI is a specific form of Inversion of Control, where the control of creating and managing dependencies is inverted from the application logic to a container or framework.

## 2. Built-In DI Container in ASP.NET Core

### Registration and Composition Root
- **Composition Root:**  
  All service registrations are performed in the `ConfigureServices` method in `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` in minimal hosting models). This centralizes dependency configuration.
  
- **Service Collection:**  
  ASP.NET Core uses an `IServiceCollection` to collect all service registrations, which is then built into an `IServiceProvider` by the framework.
  ```typescript
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      // Register framework services (e.g., MVC controllers)
      services.AddControllers();

      // Register custom services with various lifetimes
      services.AddTransient<IMyTransientService, MyTransientService>();
      services.AddScoped<IMyScopedService, MyScopedService>();
      services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>();
  }
```

**Service Lifetimes
Transient:**
A new instance is created every time a service is requested.

**Scoped:**
A single instance is maintained within a scope, such as an HTTP request.

**Singleto**n:
A single instance is created once and shared for the entire application lifetime.

**Service Resolution
Constructor Injection:**
ASP.NET Core controllers and middleware use constructor injection. The DI container automatically resolves dependencies by examining the constructor parameters.

```typescript
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyScopedService _scopedService;

    public HomeController(IMyScopedService scopedService)
    {
        _scopedService = scopedService;
    }
    
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        // Use _scopedService for business logic
        return View();
    }
}
```

**3. Integration with the ASP.NET Core Pipeline
Middleware and DI
Middleware Registration:**
Middleware components can also use DI by defining constructor parameters for their dependencies.

```typescript
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, IMyService myService)
    {
        _next = next;
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        _myService.PerformOperation();
        await _next(context);
    }
}

// In Startup.Configure:
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => endpoints.MapControllers());
}
```

**Integration with Framework Features
Controllers, Razor Pages, and SignalR:**
ASP.NET Core automatically injects dependencies into controllers, Razor pages, and hubs (SignalR) via constructor injection, leveraging the built-in DI container.

**4. Advanced Topics in ASP.NET Core DI
Open Generic Registrations
Definition:**
Registering open generic types allows you to register a generic service without specifying type parameters.

```typescript
services.AddTransient(typeof(IRepository<>), typeof(Repository<>));
```
**Conditional and Named Registrations
Conditional Logic:**
Use conditional statements or factory delegates in ConfigureServices to register different implementations based on configuration or environment.

```typescript
bool useMock = Configuration.GetValue<bool>("UseMockService");
if (useMock)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MockService>();
}
else
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, RealService>();
}
```
**Lifetime and Disposal Management
Scope Disposal:**
Scoped services are disposed automatically at the end of the request. Singleton services are disposed when the application shuts down.
**
Asynchronous Disposal:**
The container in .NET 6+ supports IAsyncDisposable, ensuring that asynchronous resources are cleaned up properly.
