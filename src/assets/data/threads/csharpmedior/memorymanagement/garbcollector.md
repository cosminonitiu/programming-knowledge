**a. Managed Heap and Unmanaged Heap**

- **Managed Heap**: In .NET, objects are stored in the managed heap. The GC tracks the objects in the managed heap and determines when they are no longer needed.
- **Unmanaged Heap**: Refers to the memory managed by the operating system or non-.NET resources (such as memory used by unmanaged code or native libraries). These objects are not handled by the GC. Instead, developers need to manage the memory explicitly, often using `Dispose()` and the `IDisposable` interface.

**b. Roots**

- **Root references** are the starting point for determining which objects are reachable and which are not. Roots include local variables, static fields, and CPU registers that reference objects.

**c. Generations**

- .NETâ€™s garbage collector works on the concept of **generations**. It categorizes objects into **three generations** to optimize memory collection:The garbage collector first collects **Generation 0**, then **Generation 1**, and finally **Generation 2**. The idea is that **Generation 0** objects are typically short-lived and are collected frequently, while objects in **Generation 2** tend to be long-lived and are collected less often.
    - **Generation 0 (Gen 0)**: Newly created objects (most objects are collected here).
    - **Generation 1 (Gen 1)**: Objects that have survived one GC cycle (short-lived objects).
    - **Generation 2 (Gen 2)**: Long-lived objects that have survived multiple GC cycles.

**d. Finalization**

- **Finalization** refers to the cleanup of unmanaged resources (e.g., file handles, database connections) before an object is reclaimed by the GC. If an object has a **finalizer** (`~ClassName()`), the GC calls it before deallocating memory. However, finalizers are not guaranteed to run immediately after an object becomes unreachable.

Example of a Disposable Comp:
```typescript
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
    private bool disposed = false;

    // Simulate an unmanaged resource.
    IntPtr unmanagedResource = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(100);

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources.
            }

            // Free unmanaged resources
            Marshal.FreeHGlobal(unmanagedResource);
            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~ResourceHolder()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (ResourceHolder holder = new ResourceHolder())
        {
            // Use the resource
        } // Automatic disposal here
    }
}
```

**Here are key aspects of memory management in .NET:**

**Garbage Collection**: Automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable objects, freeing developers from manually deallocating memory and helping to avoid memory leaks.

**Dispose Pattern**: Implementing the IDisposable interface and the Dispose method allows for the cleanup of unmanaged resources (such as file handles, database connections, etc.) that the GC cannot reclaim automatically.

**Finalizers**: Can be defined in classes to perform cleanup operations before the object is collected by the GC. However, overuse of finalizers can negatively impact performance, as it makes objects live longer than necessary.

**Using Statements**: A syntactic sugar for calling Dispose on IDisposable objects, ensuring that resources are freed as soon as they are no longer needed, even if exceptions are thrown.
**
Large Object Heap (LOH) Management**: Large objects are allocated on a separate heap, and knowing how to manage large object allocations can help reduce memory fragmentation and improve performance.
