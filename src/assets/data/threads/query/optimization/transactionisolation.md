Transaction isolation is a critical concept in database management systems (DBMS) that determines how transactions interact with each other and how changes made by one transaction are visible to others. Proper isolation ensures data integrity and consistency while balancing performance and concurrency.

**1. What is Transaction Isolation?**
Definition: Transaction isolation defines the degree to which one transaction is visible to other transactions concurrently executing in the database.
Purpose: Ensures that transactions execute in isolation, preventing interference and maintaining data integrity.

**2. Isolation Levels**
Most DBMSs support multiple isolation levels, each offering a different balance between consistency and performance. The four standard isolation levels are defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard:

**a. Read Uncommitted**
Definition: The lowest isolation level. Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions (dirty reads).
Use Case: Rarely used due to the risk of dirty reads.

Example:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- May read uncommitted data.
```

b. Read Committed
Definition: Ensures that transactions only see committed changes. Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

Use Case: Default isolation level in many DBMSs (e.g., PostgreSQL, Oracle).

Example:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Only reads committed data.
```

c. Repeatable Read
Definition: Ensures that if a transaction reads the same data multiple times, it will see the same values (prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads). Phantom reads are still possible.

Use Case: Useful when consistent reads are required within a transaction.

Example:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1; -- Ensures repeatable reads.
```

**4. Common Isolation Issues**
**a. Dirty Reads**
Definition: A transaction reads uncommitted changes from another transaction.

Example:
Transaction A updates a row but does not commit.
Transaction B reads the uncommitted change.
Transaction A rolls back, but Transaction B has already read invalid data.

**b. Non-Repeatable Reads**
Definition: A transaction reads the same row multiple times and sees different values because another transaction has modified or deleted the row.

Example:
Transaction A reads a row.
Transaction B updates or deletes the row and commits.
Transaction A reads the same row again and sees different or missing data.

**c. Phantom Reads**
Definition: A transaction reads a set of rows multiple times and sees additional rows because another transaction has inserted new rows.

Example:
Transaction A reads a set of rows.
Transaction B inserts a new row and commits.
Transaction A reads the same set of rows again and sees an additional row.

**5. Choosing the Right Isolation Level**
Read Uncommitted: Rarely used due to the risk of dirty reads.
Read Committed: Suitable for most applications where dirty reads are unacceptable but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are tolerable.
Repeatable Read: Useful for applications requiring consistent reads within a transaction.
Serializable: Used wh
