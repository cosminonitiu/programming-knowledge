CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates the handling of commands (write operations) and queries (read operations). This allows for more efficient and scalable handling of data in systems with complex domains. CQRS is particularly useful when the read and write workloads are significantly different or when the system needs to scale differently for read and write operations.

### **Key Concepts of CQRS**:

- **Commands** represent actions that change the state of the system (e.g., creating or updating a resource).
- **Queries** represent actions that retrieve data without modifying the systemâ€™s state.
- **Command Handlers** and **Query Handlers** process commands and queries respectively.
