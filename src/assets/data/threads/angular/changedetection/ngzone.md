Angular ngZone

Angular’s change detection is powered by Zone.js through the **NgZone** service. NgZone provides an execution context that automatically detects and responds to asynchronous events—ensuring that your view stays in sync with your data without manual intervention.

## What is NgZone?

- **NgZone** is an injectable Angular service that wraps Zone.js. It patches asynchronous APIs (such as `setTimeout`, Promises, and event listeners) so that Angular can know when an async operation finishes and trigger change detection.
- Zones are hierarchical execution contexts. Angular creates an “Angular zone” (often seen as the `_inner` zone) to run your application code, while the outer (or root) zone remains unpatched. This division allows Angular to automatically run change detection when tasks inside the Angular zone complete.

## Key Methods of NgZone

### `run(fn)`
- **Purpose:** Re-enters the Angular zone to execute a function.
- **Usage:** Use this when you need to update application state or the UI.
- **Example:**
```typescript
  this.ngZone.run(() => {
    this.someProperty = newValue; // Triggers change detection
  });
```

**runOutsideAngular(fn)**
Purpose: Executes a function outside the Angular zone.

Usage: Ideal for performance-critical or high-frequency operations (e.g., mousemove events, animations) that do not require immediate UI updates.

Example:

```typescript
this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
  window.setInterval(() => {
    // This code runs outside Angular’s zone and won’t trigger change detection automatically.
    this.performHeavyCalculation();
  }, 10);
}); 
```

**Why Use NgZone?**
**Automatic Change Detection:**
Angular uses NgZone to know when to run change detection after async tasks complete. This relieves you from manually calling detectChanges() for most scenarios.

**Performance Optimization:**
Running non-UI-related code outside the Angular zone reduces the number of unnecessary change detection cycles. You can then selectively re-enter the zone (using run()) when a UI update is truly needed.

**Third-Party Library Integration:**
When integrating libraries that execute code outside Angular’s zone (like some JSONP or DOM-manipulation libraries), wrapping their callbacks with ngZone.run() ensures Angular is aware of updates.
