### **5. Event Sourcing**

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where state changes are captured as a sequence of events. Instead of storing just the current state of an entity in a database, the system stores all the events that lead to the current state. This allows for more flexible tracking of changes, and it can support advanced features like auditing, rebuilding state, and time travel.

### **Key Concepts of Event Sourcing**:

- **Events**: Represents state transitions or actions that have occurred.
- **Event Store**: A storage system that holds the events.
- **Command Handlers**: Handle incoming commands and generate events.
- **Event Handlers**: Update the system state by processing events.

- **Unit Testing & Mocking**: Test-driven development, writing effective unit tests using tools like xUnit, NUnit, and mock frameworks like Moq.
- **Security**: JWT, OAuth, securing APIs, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other security practices.
- **DevOps and CI/CD**: Working with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies, database optimization, memory management, and profiling tools.
