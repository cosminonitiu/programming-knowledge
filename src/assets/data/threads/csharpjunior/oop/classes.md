In C#, classes can be categorized based on their functionality and accessibility:

**Static classes**: Cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members.
**Sealed classes**: Cannot be inherited from.
**Abstract classes**: Cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited from.
**Partial classes**: Allow the splitting of a class definition across multiple files.
**Generic classes**: Allow the definition of classes with placeholders for the type of its fields, methods, parameters, etc.

Each type serves different purposes in the context of object-oriented programming and design patterns.
