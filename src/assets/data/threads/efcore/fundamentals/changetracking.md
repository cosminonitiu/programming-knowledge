Change tracking is a core feature of EF Core that automatically detects modifications made to entities retrieved from the database. This mechanism allows EF Core to determine what changes need to be persisted when you call `SaveChanges()`, without requiring you to manually specify the state of each entity.

## 1. What is Change Tracking?

- **Definition:**  
  Change tracking is the process by which EF Core monitors the state of your entities (e.g., Added, Modified, Deleted, Unchanged) and records any modifications made to them during the lifetime of a `DbContext`.

- **Purpose:**  
  It enables automatic generation of SQL commands to insert, update, or delete data in the database based on the detected changes.

## 2. How Change Tracking Works

### **Snapshot-Based Tracking**
- **Default Mechanism:**  
  When an entity is queried from the database, EF Core creates a snapshot of its original values. Later, when changes occur, EF Core compares the current state of the entity with the snapshot to determine which properties have been modified.

- **State Transitions:**  
  - **Added:** An entity that is new and will be inserted.
  - **Modified:** An entity that exists in the database and has been changed.
  - **Deleted:** An entity that is marked for deletion.
  - **Unchanged:** An entity that has not been altered since it was retrieved.

### **Change Detection Process**
- **Automatic Detection:**  
  EF Core automatically detects changes when you call `SaveChanges()`, or you can manually trigger detection using `ChangeTracker.DetectChanges()`.
- **Performance Considerations:**  
  Automatic change tracking simplifies development but can introduce overhead in scenarios with many entities. In such cases, you may choose to disable automatic tracking or use “No-Tracking” queries for read-only operations.

## 3. Configuring and Customizing Change Tracking

### **No-Tracking Queries**
- **Purpose:**  
  When you only need to read data without performing updates, no-tracking queries reduce overhead.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  var products = context.Products.AsNoTracking().ToList();
  ```

  **Change Tracking Behavior Settings
QueryTrackingBehavior:**
You can configure the default tracking behavior for a DbContext:

```typescript
optionsBuilder.UseQueryTrackingBehavior(QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking);
```

**Manual Change Detection:**
In some performance-critical applications, you may control when EF Core checks for changes:

```typescript
context.ChangeTracker.AutoDetectChangesEnabled = false;
// Manually call when needed:
context.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges();
```

**4. Concurrency and Change Tracking
Optimistic Concurrency:**
Change tracking plays a key role in optimistic concurrency control. EF Core can use concurrency tokens (e.g., a rowversion column) to detect if an entity has been modified since it was last read.

Example:

```typescript
public class Product
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    
    [Timestamp]
    public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }
}
```
When SaveChanges() is called, EF Core includes the original RowVersion value in the WHERE clause of the update statement to ensure the record has not been changed by another process.

** Best Practices for Change Tracking
Use No-Tracking for Read-Only Operations:**
This minimizes overhead when you don't plan to update entities.

**Scope Your DbContext Appropriately:**
Keep the lifespan of your DbContext short to avoid memory bloat from tracking too many entities.

**Manually Manage Detection in Performance-Critical Code:**
Consider disabling auto-detection and calling DetectChanges() explicitly when necessary.

**Understand Concurrency Implications:**
Leverage concurrency tokens and handle DbUpdateConcurrencyException to maintain data integrity in multi-user scenarios.
