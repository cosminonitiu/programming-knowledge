## 1. ISerializable

### Overview
- **Namespace:**  
  `System.Runtime.Serialization`
- **Definition:**  
  The `ISerializable` interface allows an object to control its own serialization and deserialization. It defines a single method, `GetObjectData`, which is used to populate a `SerializationInfo` object with the data needed to serialize the object.
- **Core Method:**
  ```csharp
  void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context);
  ```

**Purpose and Use Cases**
**Custom Serialization:**
When the default serialization process (typically provided by the [Serializable] attribute) is insufficientâ€”for example, when you need to exclude certain fields or perform transformation on the data during serialization.

**Versioning Support:**
To manage different versions of a class during deserialization by including extra metadata or custom logic.

**Security Considerations:**
To avoid inadvertently serializing sensitive information or to enforce security policies during the serialization process.

How It Works
**Serialization Process:**

When an object implementing ISerializable is serialized, the formatter calls GetObjectData, passing a SerializationInfo instance.

The object adds key-value pairs representing its state to the SerializationInfo.

During deserialization, the formatter looks for a special constructor that takes SerializationInfo and StreamingContext parameters.

**Deserialization Constructor:**
Classes that implement ISerializable must provide a constructor with the following signature:

```csharp
protected MyClass(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
```
This constructor extracts the serialized data from the SerializationInfo and initializes the object accordingly.

**Example Implementation**
```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Employee : ISerializable
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // Suppose we want to exclude the Salary field from serialization for security reasons
    public decimal Salary { get; set; } 

    public Employee() { }

    // The serialization constructor
    protected Employee(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        // Retrieve values from SerializationInfo
        Id = info.GetInt32("Id");
        Name = info.GetString("Name");
        // Salary is not deserialized as it's considered sensitive
    }

    // Method called during serialization to populate SerializationInfo
    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        info.AddValue("Id", Id);
        info.AddValue("Name", Name);
        // Do not add Salary to SerializationInfo
    }
}
```

**2. IDeserializationCallback
Overview
Namespace:**
System.Runtime.Serialization

**Definition**:
The IDeserializationCallback interface provides a method that is called when the entire object graph has been deserialized. This is useful for performing any final initialization or validation that depends on the deserialized object graph.

**Core Method:**

```csharp
void OnDeserialization(object sender);
```
**Purpose and Use Cases**
**Post-Deserialization Initialization:**
When certain initialization logic cannot be performed in the deserialization constructor because it depends on other objects that may not yet be deserialized.

**Validation and Fix-Up:**
To validate the integrity of the deserialized object graph and perform any necessary fix-ups (e.g., re-establishing links between objects).

**Complex Object Graphs:**
Particularly useful when working with interrelated objects that require consistency after being deserialized.

**How It Works**
**Deserialization Process:**
After the deserialization of an object graph is complete, the runtime calls the OnDeserialization method for each object that implements IDeserializationCallback.

**Timing:**
This method is invoked after the entire object graph has been restored, ensuring that dependencies between objects are resolved.

**Example Implementation**
```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Department : IDeserializationCallback
{
    public string DepartmentName { get; set; }
    public List<Employee> Employees { get; set; } = new List<Employee>();

    // This method is called after the entire object graph has been deserialized.
    public void OnDeserialization(object sender)
    {
        // Perform any fix-ups or validation here.
        if (Employees == null)
        {
            Employees = new List<Employee>();
        }
        // For example, ensure that all employee references are set correctly.
        foreach (var employee in Employees)
        {
            employee.Department = this;
        }
    }
}

[Serializable]
public class Employee : ISerializable
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // This property is a reference to the Department, set during fix-up
    [NonSerialized]
    public Department Department { get; set; }

    public Employee() { }

    protected Employee(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        Id = info.GetInt32("Id");
        Name = info.GetString("Name");
        // Department is not serialized; it's re-established in OnDeserialization
    }

    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        info.AddValue("Id", Id);
        info.AddValue("Name", Name);
    }
}
```

**3. Best Practices and Considerations
For ISerializable
Explicit Versioning:**
Consider including version information in your SerializationInfo to manage changes in your class structure over time.

**Consistent Serialization:**
Ensure that the data added in GetObjectData matches what is expected in the deserialization constructor.

**Security:**
Avoid serializing sensitive data, or apply encryption if necessary.

**For IDeserializationCallback
Post-Processing:**
Use OnDeserialization to perform any initialization that depends on the complete object graph. This is especially useful for re-establishing relationships between objects.

**Error Handling:**
Validate the deserialized data and handle errors appropriately, as objects may be in an inconsistent state before OnDeserialization is called.

**General Considerations
Performance Impact:**
Custom serialization logic can be more complex and may introduce performance overhead, so use it only when necessary.

**Testing:**
Thoroughly test serialization and deserialization processes, especially when using custom logic, to ensure data integrity and correctness across different versions.
