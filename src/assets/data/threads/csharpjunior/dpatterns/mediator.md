## 1. Overview

### Definition and Purpose
- **Definition:**  
  The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
  
- **Primary Goals:**
  - **Decoupling:**  
    Reduce the dependencies between communicating objects (colleagues) by introducing a mediator.
  - **Centralized Control:**  
    Centralize communication logic in a single mediator, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Flexibility:**  
    Change interaction behavior without modifying the colleagues. This makes it easier to add, remove, or modify interactions.

## 2. Core Components and Internal Mechanics

### Key Participants
- **Mediator Interface:**  
  Declares methods for communication between colleague objects.
  ```typescript
  public interface IMediator
  {
      void Send(string message, Colleague sender);
  }
  ```

**Concrete Mediator:**
Implements the mediator interface and coordinates the interaction between colleague objects. It holds references to the colleague objects and encapsulates the interaction logic.

```typescript
public class ConcreteMediator : IMediator
{
    public Colleague1 Colleague1 { get; set; }
    public Colleague2 Colleague2 { get; set; }

    public void Send(string message, Colleague sender)
    {
        if (sender == Colleague1)
            Colleague2.Receive(message);
        else
            Colleague1.Receive(message);
    }
}
```

**Colleague Classes:**
The objects that need to communicate. They know about the mediator but not about each other.

```typescript
public abstract class Colleague
{
    protected IMediator _mediator;
    public Colleague(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }
    public abstract void Receive(string message);
}

public class Colleague1 : Colleague
{
    public Colleague1(IMediator mediator) : base(mediator) { }
    public override void Receive(string message) => Console.WriteLine("Colleague1 received: " + message);
    public void Send(string message) => _mediator.Send(message, this);
}

public class Colleague2 : Colleague
{
    public Colleague2(IMediator mediator) : base(mediator) { }
    public override void Receive(string message) => Console.WriteLine("Colleague2 received: " + message);
    public void Send(string message) => _mediator.Send(message, this);
}
```

**Internal Mechanics
Centralization:**
The mediator serves as the central hub for communication. Instead of colleagues calling each other directly, they send messages to the mediator.

**Loose Coupling:**
Colleague objects do not hold references to each other. This reduces dependencies and makes it easier to modify the interactions between colleagues.

**Dynamic Interaction:**
The mediator can implement complex logic to determine how messages are routed, allowing for dynamic changes in behavior without modifying individual colleague classes.

**State Management:**
In more advanced scenarios, the mediator may maintain state or context information that affects communication logic (e.g., switching modes of operation).

**3. Real-World Use Cases
Use Case 1: UI Event Handling**
Scenario:
In a complex user interface, multiple controls (buttons, text fields, etc.) may need to interact. A mediator can centralize event handling, ensuring that a change in one control can update others without tight coupling.

Benefits:
Simplifies the UI code by encapsulating interaction logic within the mediator.

**Use Case 2: Chat Application**
Scenario:
In a chat application, users (or chat rooms) communicate with each other indirectly. A mediator (chat server) handles message distribution to connected clients.

Benefits:
The server acts as a mediator, decoupling clients from direct communication and allowing for centralized control (e.g., filtering messages, handling user presence).

**Use Case 3: Workflow Coordination**
Scenario:
In a business process management system, multiple modules (order processing, payment, inventory) need to coordinate actions. A mediator can orchestrate the workflow between these modules.

Benefits:
Changes in one module’s behavior do not ripple across the entire system; the mediator manages dependencies.

**Use Case in .NET Framework
WPF and MVVM:**
In WPF applications following the MVVM pattern, a mediator (or messaging system like the EventAggregator in Prism) is used to communicate between ViewModels. This decouples different parts of the application and simplifies maintenance.

**4. Best Practices and Interview Discussion Points
Best Practices
Keep It Focused:**
The mediator should handle communication, not business logic. It centralizes interactions but should not become a "god object."

**Clear Contracts:**
Define clear interfaces for both the mediator and the colleagues to ensure a consistent and maintainable communication protocol.

**Dynamic and Extensible:**
Design the mediator to be flexible. It should be easy to add new colleague types without changing the mediator's interface.
**
Avoid Overuse:**
Use the mediator pattern when multiple objects interact in complex ways. Overusing it can lead to a centralized class that is difficult to manage.

**Decouple Using Dependency Injection:**
Consider injecting the mediator into colleague objects to improve testability and maintain loose coupling.

**Interview Discussion Points
Explain the Motivation:**
Discuss how the mediator pattern reduces coupling by centralizing communications and why that’s beneficial in large systems.

**Compare with Observer Pattern:**
Explain the differences and similarities, such as centralized coordination (Mediator) versus decentralized notification (Observer).

**Discuss Real-World Examples:**
Be ready to talk about UI event handling, chat systems, or workflow coordinators.
**
Highlight Potential Drawbacks:**
Mention that while the mediator simplifies interactions, it can become a bottleneck or "god object" if not carefully designed.
