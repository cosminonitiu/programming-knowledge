Threading allows your application to run multiple blocks of code at the same time (or in parallel if your system has multiple CPU cores). This is crucial for creating efficient and responsive applicationsâ€”especially when dealing with tasks like heavy computations or network calls.

## What Is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution that an operating system can schedule. When you start a C# program, you already have one thread (the **main thread**). If needed, you can create more threads to perform additional tasks simultaneously.

- **Parallelism**: Multiple tasks literally run at the same time on different CPU cores.  
- **Concurrency**: Tasks can switch between each other rapidly on a single core, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution.

## Why Use Threads?

1. **Responsiveness**  
   - Prevents the application (especially the UI) from freezing while long tasks run.  

2. **Performance**  
   - Takes advantage of multi-core processors by doing work in parallel.  

3. **Multitasking**  
   - Lets you handle multiple operations at once (e.g., reading a file while waiting for a web request to complete).

## Basic Threading in C\#

You can create and start a new thread in C# using the `Thread` class from `System.Threading`:

```typescript
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Thread newThread = new Thread(MyThreadMethod);
        newThread.Start();  // Starts MyThreadMethod on a new thread

        // The main thread continues its own work
        Console.WriteLine("Main thread is running...");
    }

    static void MyThreadMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from the new thread!");
    }
}
```

**Key Points**
A new Thread is created by passing the method to its constructor.
Calling Start() begins execution of that method on the new thread.
Once started, it runs concurrently with the main thread.

## Multithreading

Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. In C#, multithreading is achieved using threads, which are lightweight units of execution. However, managing threads and shared resources can be challenging, especially when dealing with synchronization and thread safety. This is where concepts like Mutex, Semaphore, and the lock keyword come into play.

**1. Process vs Thread**
**a. Process**
Definition: A process is an instance of a running program. It has its own memory space, resources, and at least one thread (the main thread).
Characteristics:
Independent memory space.
Heavyweight (expensive to create and manage).
Processes do not share memory by default (inter-process communication is required).

**b. Thread**
Definition: A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same memory space.
Characteristics:
Shares memory and resources with other threads in the same process.
Lightweight (cheaper to create and manage compared to processes).
Requires synchronization when accessing shared resources.

**2. Mutex**
Definition: A Mutex (Mutual Exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
Purpose: Prevent race conditions by allowing exclusive access to a resource.
Scope: Can be used across processes (system-wide) or within a single process.

**3. Semaphore**
Definition: A Semaphore is a synchronization primitive that limits the number of threads that can access a shared resource simultaneously.
Purpose: Control access to a resource pool (e.g., database connections).
Parameters:
initialCount: The initial number of requests that can be granted concurrently.
maximumCount: The maximum number of requests that can be granted concurrently.

**4. lock Keyword**
Definition: The lock keyword is a shorthand for acquiring a mutual exclusion lock on an object, ensuring that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time.
Purpose: Simplify thread synchronization by providing a built-in mechanism for mutual exclusion.

How It Works:
The lock keyword uses a monitor behind the scenes to ensure thread safety.
When a thread enters the lock block, it acquires an exclusive lock on the lockObject.
Other threads attempting to enter the lock block will block until the lock is released.

**5. Role of the Object Inside the lock**
Purpose: The object used in the lock statement serves as a synchronization token.

Key Points:
The object must be a reference type (e.g., object, string).
It should be private and readonly to prevent external code from locking on the same object.
The object itself is not modified; it is used only for synchronization.

**6. How lock Works Behind the Scenes**
The lock keyword is syntactic sugar for the Monitor class.

Monitor:
Ensures that only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.
Provides additional methods like TryEnter and Wait.
