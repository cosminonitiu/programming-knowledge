## 1. Overview

### What is Dependency Injection?
- **Definition:**  
  Dependency Injection is a technique where an object's dependencies (i.e., the services or objects it needs to function) are "injected" into it rather than being created internally. This allows the behavior of the class to be configured from the outside.
- **Primary Goals:**  
  - **Loose Coupling:**  
    Reduce direct dependencies between components, making them more modular and easier to test.
  - **Improved Testability:**  
    Allows for easy mocking or stubbing of dependencies during unit testing.
  - **Flexibility and Maintainability:**  
    Changing a dependency does not require changes to the dependent class, enabling better scalability and maintenance.

## 2. DI Principles and Techniques

### Inversion of Control (IoC)
- **Concept:**  
  DI is a specific form of Inversion of Control, where the control of creating dependencies is inverted: instead of the class instantiating its dependencies, an external entity (the IoC container or DI framework) is responsible for providing them.

### Types of Dependency Injection
- **Constructor Injection:**  
  Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
```typescript
  public interface ILogger
  {
      void Log(string message);
  }

  public class ConsoleLogger : ILogger
  {
      public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
  }

  public class OrderService
  {
      private readonly ILogger _logger;

      // Dependencies are injected via the constructor.
      public OrderService(ILogger logger)
      {
          _logger = logger;
      }

      public void ProcessOrder(int orderId)
      {
          _logger.Log($"Processing order {orderId}");
          // Order processing logic...
      }
  }
  ```

  **Setter (Property) Injection:**
Dependencies are assigned via public properties.

```typescript
public class OrderService
{
    public ILogger Logger { get; set; }

    public void ProcessOrder(int orderId)
    {
        Logger?.Log($"Processing order {orderId}");
        // Order processing logic...
    }`
}
```
**Method Injection:**
Dependencies are passed as parameters to methods that require them.

```typescript
public class OrderService
{
    public void ProcessOrder(int orderId, ILogger logger)
    {
        logger.Log($"Processing order {orderId}");
        // Order processing logic...
    }
}
```

**3. DI Containers in .NET**
**Built-in DI (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)**
Overview:
.NET Core and ASP.NET Core provide a built-in DI container, which supports constructor injection out-of-the-box.

Configuration Example:

```typescript
// In Startup.cs for an ASP.NET Core application:
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<ILogger, ConsoleLogger>(); // Singleton lifetime
    services.AddTransient<OrderService>();             // Transient lifetime
}```
Usage:
The DI container automatically resolves dependencies for controllers and other registered services.

**Third-Party Containers
Popular Choices:
Autofac, Ninject, StructureMap, Castle Windsor.**

Example with Autofac:

```typescript
var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
builder.RegisterType<ConsoleLogger>().As<ILogger>().SingleInstance();
builder.RegisterType<OrderService>().InstancePerDependency();
IContainer container = builder.Build();

using (var scope = container.BeginLifetimeScope())
{
    var orderService = scope.Resolve<OrderService>();
    orderService.ProcessOrder(123);
}
```
**Choosing a Container
Considerations:**

**Simplicity vs. Features:**
The built-in container is simple and sufficient for many applications, while third-party containers offer more advanced features like interception, property injection, and more flexible lifetime management.

**Integration:**
Evaluate how well the container integrates with your application framework and existing libraries.

**4. Real-World Use Cases
Web Applications**
Scenario:
In ASP.NET Core applications, DI is used to inject services such as logging, data repositories, and business services into controllers and middleware.

Benefit:
This decouples the controller logic from concrete implementations, making testing and maintenance easier.

**Microservices Architecture**
Scenario:
In microservices, DI helps manage and configure dependencies like service clients, caching providers, and messaging services.

Benefit:
Promotes modular design and facilitates service isolation and scalability.

**Desktop and Mobile Applications**
Scenario:
In WPF or Xamarin applications, DI is used to inject view models and services into views.

Benefit:
Improves separation of concerns, enabling better unit testing and maintainability.

**5. Best Practices and Technical Considerations
Best Practices
Prefer Constructor Injection:**
It makes dependencies explicit and supports immutability.

**Minimize Property Injection:**
Use property injection only when necessary (e.g., for optional dependencies or circular dependencies).

**Register Dependencies Appropriately:**
Choose the correct lifetime (Transient, Scoped, Singleton) based on your application's requirements.

**Avoid Service Locator Anti-Pattern:**
Do not hide dependencies by using a service locator; instead, let the DI container resolve them explicitly.

**Keep Configuration Centralized:**
Manage all DI registrations in one place (e.g., Startup.cs, a composition root) to maintain a clear overview of the application's dependency graph.

**Interview Tips
Explain the Concepts:**
Be prepared to explain DI principles, benefits, and how they improve code maintainability and testability.
**
Discuss Container Choices:**
Compare the built-in DI container with third-party options, mentioning features like interception, property injection, and more flexible lifetimes.

**Provide Real-World Examples:**
Use scenarios from web applications, microservices, or desktop applications to illustrate how DI decouples components and promotes a modular architecture.

**Talk About Testing:**
Emphasize how DI facilitates unit testing by allowing the injection of mock implementations.
