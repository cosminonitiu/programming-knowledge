Lazy Injection and Factory Delegates are advanced dependency injection techniques in .NET that provide flexible and efficient ways to manage object creation. They both help defer instantiation until it's needed, which can improve performance, reduce memory overhead, and enable more dynamic scenarios.

## 1. Lazy Injection

### Definition
- **Lazy Injection:**  
  Lazy Injection leverages the `Lazy<T>` type to delay the instantiation of a dependency until it is actually accessed. This is particularly useful for expensive-to-create objects or when the dependency may not be needed in every execution path.

### How It Works Under the Hood
- **Lazy<T> Basics:**  
  - `Lazy<T>` is a wrapper that defers the creation of an instance of `T` until its `Value` property is accessed.
  - It supports thread-safe initialization, meaning that even in multi-threaded scenarios, the object is created only once.
  - The `Lazy<T>` constructor can accept a delegate (typically a lambda) that specifies how to instantiate the object.
  
- **Internal Mechanism:**  
  The first time `Value` is accessed, `Lazy<T>` calls the provided factory delegate, caches the result, and returns it. Subsequent accesses to `Value` return the cached instance. This caching mechanism prevents redundant construction while ensuring that the dependency is not created unless required.

  ### Example
```typescript
public interface IExpensiveService
{
    void Execute();
}

public class ExpensiveService : IExpensiveService
{
    public ExpensiveService()
    {
        // Simulate expensive initialization.
        Console.WriteLine("ExpensiveService: Initialization complete.");
    }

    public void Execute()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ExpensiveService: Execution started.");
    }
}

public class Consumer
{
    // Lazy injection of IExpensiveService.
    private readonly Lazy<IExpensiveService> _expensiveService;

    public Consumer(Lazy<IExpensiveService> expensiveService)
    {
        _expensiveService = expensiveService;
    }

    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Consumer: Running without using expensive service.");
        // Only create the expensive service if needed.
        if (/* some condition */ true)
        {
            _expensiveService.Value.Execute();
        }
    }
}

// Registration with a DI container (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)
services.AddTransient<IExpensiveService, ExpensiveService>();
services.AddTransient<Consumer>();
// The container will automatically wrap IExpensiveService in Lazy<T> if configured.
```

**2. Factory Delegates
Definition
Factory Delegates:**
Factory Delegates involve injecting a delegate (typically a Func<T>) that is responsible for creating an instance of a dependency on demand. This approach gives more control over instantiation, such as creating new instances each time or applying custom logic during creation.

**How It Works Under the Hood
Delegate-Based Creation:**

Instead of passing an already-constructed object, you pass a delegate that returns an instance of the object when called.

This delegate can be as simple as a lambda expression that calls the constructor of the dependency.

**Flexibility and Dynamism:**
The factory delegate allows the consuming class to create instances on the fly. Itâ€™s particularly useful when the dependency must be created with specific runtime parameters or when you need multiple instances over time (e.g., for transient services).

```typescript
public interface IWorker
{
    void DoWork();
}

public class Worker : IWorker
{
    public Worker()
    {
        // Simulate some complex initialization.
        Console.WriteLine("Worker: Initialized.");
    }

    public void DoWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Worker: Working...");
    }
}

public class TaskManager
{
    // Inject a factory delegate that creates IWorker instances.
    private readonly Func<IWorker> _workerFactory;

    public TaskManager(Func<IWorker> workerFactory)
    {
        _workerFactory = workerFactory;
    }

    public void ExecuteTask()
    {
        // Create a new worker each time a task is executed.
        IWorker worker = _workerFactory();
        worker.DoWork();
    }
}

// Registration using a DI container:
services.AddTransient<IWorker, Worker>();
services.AddTransient<TaskManager>();
// The DI container can automatically resolve Func<IWorker> as a factory delegate.
```

**3. Use Cases and Advantages
When to Use Lazy Injection
Expensive Initialization:**
Use Lazy Injection for services or objects that are resource-intensive to create and may not be needed immediately.

**Conditional Execution:**
If the dependency is only required under certain conditions, lazy initialization prevents unnecessary work.

**Performance Optimization:**
Improves startup time and reduces memory usage by deferring object creation.

**When to Use Factory Delegates
Dynamic Instance Creation:**
Use factory delegates when you need to create new instances repeatedly (e.g., for transient objects) or when constructor parameters need to be provided at runtime.

**Avoiding Captive Dependencies:**
Helps prevent issues where a singleton or long-lived service holds onto a dependency that should be created fresh each time.

**Flexible Object Creation:**
Allows you to encapsulate custom logic or parameterization in the factory delegate.

**4. Memory and Performance Considerations
Lazy Injection
Memory Overhead:**
Lazy<T> adds a small memory overhead to track its initialization state. However, this is often outweighed by the savings from not creating an object until it is needed.

**Thread Safety:**
The default thread-safety modes of Lazy<T> (e.g., LazyThreadSafetyMode.ExecutionAndPublication) ensure that only one instance is created in multi-threaded scenarios, avoiding redundant allocations.

**Factory Delegates
Flexibility vs. Overhead:**
Using a delegate (e.g., Func<T>) introduces negligible overhead compared to direct instantiation. It provides flexibility without significant performance or memory costs.
**
Repeated Creation:**
While factory delegates enable new instance creation on each call, this could lead to increased allocation if not managed properly. Choose the right DI lifetime for the scenario.
