Angular works directly with the **real browser DOM**. Unlike some frameworks (such as React) that use a Virtual DOM to manage updates, Angular interacts with the actual DOM but employs sophisticated change detection mechanisms to efficiently update views.

## Key Points

### Direct DOM Manipulation
- **Real Browser DOM:**  
  Angular does not maintain its own virtual DOM layer. Instead, it updates the actual DOM elements through Angular’s rendering and change detection system.
  
- **Renderer2 API:**  
  To interact with the DOM in a platform-independent way, Angular provides the `Renderer2` API. This abstraction ensures that DOM manipulations are compatible with different rendering environments (e.g., server-side rendering).

### Change Detection
- **Zone.js Integration:**  
  Angular leverages Zone.js to intercept asynchronous events and automatically trigger change detection. This process updates the real DOM only when necessary, minimizing expensive DOM operations.

- **Optimized Strategies:**  
  With strategies like `OnPush` change detection, Angular minimizes checks and DOM updates by only re-evaluating components when their inputs change or when an event occurs within the component.

### View Encapsulation
- **Emulated Encapsulation (Default):**  
  Angular’s default view encapsulation mode is "Emulated." Angular processes component styles to add unique attribute selectors, scoping styles to a component’s view while still working with the real DOM.
  
- **Shadow DOM Option:**  
  Angular also supports native Shadow DOM encapsulation using `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom`. When this mode is used, Angular leverages the browser's built-in Shadow DOM to isolate component styles. Despite this, the underlying rendering still happens in the actual DOM.
