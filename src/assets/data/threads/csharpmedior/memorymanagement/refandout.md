The ref and out keywords in C# are used to pass arguments by reference instead of by value. They allow methods to modify the value of the arguments passed to them, which can be useful in certain scenarios. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

**1. ref Keyword**
Purpose: Passes an argument by reference. The method can read and modify the original variable.

Usage:
The variable must be initialized before being passed to the method.
Both the method definition and the calling code must explicitly use the ref keyword.
The ref keyword is bidirectional: the method can read and modify the original value.
Useful when you need to modify the original variable or avoid copying large structs.

**2. out Keyword**
Purpose: Passes an argument by reference, but the method is required to assign a value to it before returning.

Usage:
The variable does not need to be initialized before being passed to the method.
Both the method definition and the calling code must explicitly use the out keyword.
The out keyword is unidirectional: the method must assign a value to the parameter.
Commonly used for methods that return multiple values (e.g., TryParse methods).

**3. Common Pitfalls**
ref:
Ensure the variable is initialized before passing it.
Overuse can make code harder to understand.

out:
Forgetting to assign a value to the out parameter results in a compile-time error.
Avoid using out for non-obvious return values, as it can reduce readability.
