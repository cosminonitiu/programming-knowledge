## 1. Advanced Selectors and Memoization

### Creating Efficient Selectors
- **Purpose:**  
  Selectors retrieve slices of state from the store. They are designed to be composable and are typically memoized to prevent unnecessary recalculations.
  
- **Memoization:**  
  The `createSelector` function memoizes the results based on its input selectors. This improves performance by recomputing derived state only when its inputs change.
  
- **Combining Selectors:**  
  You can build complex selectors by composing multiple simpler selectors, which promotes reusability and maintainability.
  
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
  
  // Basic selectors
  export const selectUsers = (state) => state.users;
  export const selectFilter = (state) => state.filter;
  
  // Composite selector that computes filtered users
  export const selectFilteredUsers = createSelector(
    selectUsers,
    selectFilter,
    (users, filter) => users.filter(user => user.name.includes(filter))
  );
```

**2. Meta-Reducers
What Are Meta-Reducers?**
Definition:
Meta-reducers are higher-order reducers that wrap the root reducer. They allow you to intercept actions and state changes to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, debugging, state persistence (hydration), and undo/redo functionality.

Use Cases and Patterns
Logging:
Log every state transition for debugging purposes.

State Hydration:
Rehydrate state from local storage upon app initialization.

Resetting State:
Create a meta-reducer that resets the state when a logout action is dispatched.

Example:

```typescript
import { ActionReducer, MetaReducer } from '@ngrx/store';

export function logger(reducer: ActionReducer<any>): ActionReducer<any> {
  return (state, action) => {
    console.log('State before:', state);
    console.log('Action:', action);
    const nextState = reducer(state, action);
    console.log('State after:', nextState);
    return nextState;
  };
}

export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<any>[] = [logger]; 
```

**3. Advanced Effects
Orchestrating Complex Side Effects**
**Error Handling and Recovery:**
Use catchError, retry, or retryWhen within effects to handle errors gracefully.

**Cancellation and Concurrency:**
Choose among switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, or exhaustMap depending on whether you want to cancel previous effects, run them concurrently, or queue them.

**Combining Effects:**
Sometimes, multiple effects need to be coordinated. Use action streams and higher-order operators to manage complex sequences of side effects.

Example:
```typescript
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { mergeMap, catchError, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import * as UserActions from '../actions/user.actions';
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service';

@Injectable()
export class UserEffects {
  loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(UserActions.loadUsers),
      switchMap(() =>
        this.userService.getUsers().pipe(
          mergeMap(users => [UserActions.loadUsersSuccess({ users })]),
          catchError(error => of(UserActions.loadUsersFailure({ error })))
        )
      )
    )
  );

  constructor(private actions$: Actions, private userService: UserService) {}
} 
```

**4. NgRx Entity
Simplifying CRUD Operations
Entity Adapter:**
NgRx Entity provides helper functions to manage collections of entities, reducing boilerplate for common operations like sorting, filtering, and updating.

Usage Patterns:

Initial State:
Define an entity state and use adapter methods to create an initial state.

Reducer Integration:
Use adapter methods like addOne, updateOne, or removeOne in your reducer to manage entity collections.

Example:
```typescript
import { createEntityAdapter, EntityState } from '@ngrx/entity';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';

export interface State extends EntityState<User> {
  // additional state properties can be added here
  selectedUserId: string | null;
}

export const adapter = createEntityAdapter<User>({
  selectId: (user: User) => user.id,
  sortComparer: (a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name),
});

export const initialState: State = adapter.getInitialState({
  selectedUserId: null,
});
```

**5. Dynamic Feature States and Lazy Loading
Managing State for Lazy-Loaded Modules**
**Dynamic Reducer Registration:**
For large applications, you can register feature reducers dynamically as modules are loaded. This minimizes the initial load time and memory footprint.

**Pattern:**
Use Angularâ€™s dependency injection to register reducers in the feature module. Tools like StoreModule.forFeature() are used in conjunction with lazy loading.

**Consideration:**
Clean up state if necessary when a feature module is unloaded.

**6. Facade Pattern
Encapsulating Store Interactions**
Purpose:
A facade service abstracts NgRx store details from components. It centralizes state queries and dispatches, making components simpler and more focused on presentation.

Benefits:

Reduces boilerplate in components.

Improves testability by isolating business logic.

Example:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Store, select } from '@ngrx/store';
import * as UserActions from '../actions/user.actions';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { User } from '../models/user.model';
import { selectFilteredUsers } from '../selectors/user.selectors';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserFacade {
  users$: Observable<User[]> = this.store.pipe(select(selectFilteredUsers));

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  loadUsers() {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.loadUsers());
  }

  selectUser(userId: string) {
    this.store.dispatch(UserActions.selectUser({ userId }));
  }
}
```

**7. Debugging and Performance Optimization
Store DevTools
Integration:**
Use the NgRx Store DevTools to visualize state changes, dispatched actions, and the overall state history. This tool is invaluable for debugging complex state interactions.

**Performance:**
Optimize selectors with memoization and limit unnecessary dispatches. Custom meta-reducers can also help by logging or throttling state updates.

**Testing NgRx**
Marble Testing:
Use RxJS TestScheduler for testing effects and complex selectors.

**Isolation:**
Write unit tests for reducers, selectors, and effects to ensure individual pieces function correctly before integrating them.
