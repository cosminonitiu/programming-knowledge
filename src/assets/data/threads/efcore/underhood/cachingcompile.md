EF Core employs several caching mechanisms and compiled query strategies to enhance performance by reducing the overhead associated with query translation and execution. This section explores these techniques in depth.

## 1. First-Level Caching (DbContext-Level Cache)

- **What It Is:**  
  EF Core uses a first-level cache at the DbContext level, also known as the identity map. This cache stores all entities retrieved during the lifetime of a DbContext instance.

- **How It Works:**  
  - When you query for an entity, EF Core checks the DbContext’s cache first.
  - If the entity is found, EF Core returns the cached instance rather than querying the database again.
  - This ensures that within a single DbContext instance, each entity is uniquely tracked, maintaining consistency and reducing redundant database calls.

- **Benefits:**  
  - **Performance Improvement:** Reduces the number of database round-trips.
  - **Change Tracking Consistency:** Ensures that modifications to an entity are tracked and updated correctly when SaveChanges() is called.
  
- **Considerations:**  
  - **Scope:** The first-level cache is scoped to the DbContext instance. It is not shared across multiple DbContext instances.
  - **Lifetime Management:** Keeping a DbContext alive for too long can lead to memory overhead and stale data. Best practice is to use a short-lived DbContext per unit-of-work.

## 2. Compiled Query Strategies

- **Purpose:**  
  Compiled queries aim to reduce the overhead of query translation by caching the compiled version of a query. This is particularly useful for queries that are executed frequently.

- **How It Works:**  
  - When a LINQ query is executed, EF Core converts it into an expression tree and then into SQL. This translation process can be expensive.
  - By compiling a query, you pre-translate the LINQ expression into a delegate that can be invoked directly, bypassing the need for repeated translation.
  
- **Using Compiled Queries:**  
  - **EF.CompileQuery:**  
    EF Core provides the `EF.CompileQuery` method to compile a query once and then reuse it:
```typescript
    // Compiling a query
    var compiledQuery = EF.CompileQuery((AppDbContext context, int minPrice) =>
        context.Products.Where(p => p.Price > minPrice));
    
    // Using the compiled query
    using (var context = new AppDbContext())
    {
        var expensiveProducts = compiledQuery(context, 100);
    }
```
  - **Benefits:**  
    - Reduces the overhead of parsing and translating the query each time it is executed.
    - Particularly beneficial in high-traffic applications where the same query is run repeatedly.

## 3. Query Plan Caching and Reuse

- **Overview:**  
  EF Core internally caches query plans, which are the compiled representations of LINQ queries into SQL. This caching minimizes the performance cost of re-compiling queries that have already been executed.

- **Mechanism:**  
  - **Automatic Caching:**  
    When a query is executed, EF Core caches the query plan. Subsequent executions of the same query (with different parameter values) can reuse this plan.
  - **Plan Reuse:**  
    By reusing cached query plans, EF Core avoids the costly process of rebuilding the query’s execution plan every time, which speeds up query execution and improves scalability.

- **Key Points:**  
  - **Cache Duration:**  
    The query plan cache is maintained for the lifetime of the application or until memory pressure causes it to be cleared.
  - **Parameterization:**  
    Proper parameterization of queries is essential for effective caching, as EF Core identifies reusable plans based on the query’s structure rather than the specific parameter values.
