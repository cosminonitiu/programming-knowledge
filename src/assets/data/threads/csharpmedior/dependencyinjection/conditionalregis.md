## 1. Definition and Purpose

### What is Conditional Registration?
- **Definition:**  
  Conditional Registration is a pattern where the DI container selects among multiple potential service implementations based on conditions determined at registration time or runtime. It allows you to bind a service interface to different concrete implementations depending on configuration, environment, or other criteria.

### Why Use Conditional Registration?
- **Flexibility:**  
  Easily switch between implementations (e.g., a mock vs. a production service) without changing the consuming code.
- **Environment-Specific Behavior:**  
  Configure services differently based on environments such as development, testing, staging, or production.
- **Feature Toggling:**  
  Enable or disable features dynamically by selecting different implementations.
- **Testing:**  
  Facilitate unit testing by registering test doubles or mock implementations conditionally.

## 2. Techniques for Conditional Registration

### Using Configuration and Conditional Logic
- **Direct Conditional Statements:**  
  Within the composition root (e.g., `Startup.cs` in ASP.NET Core), you can use simple `if` statements to determine which implementation to register.
  ```typescript
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      // Assume configuration contains a key "UseMockService" that determines the implementation.
      bool useMock = Configuration.GetValue<bool>("UseMockService");
      
      if (useMock)
      {
          services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyMockService>();
      }
      else
      {
          services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyRealService>();
      }
  }
```
**Using Options Pattern:**
Combine the options pattern with conditional logic to decide on service registration based on configuration settings.

**Using Third-Party DI Container Features
Autofac Conditional Registration:**
Autofac offers more advanced mechanisms for conditional registration. For example, you can register types based on metadata or use named registrations:

```typescript
var builder = new ContainerBuilder();

// Register both implementations with metadata.
builder.RegisterType<MyRealService>()
       .As<IMyService>()
       .WithMetadata("IsMock", false);

builder.RegisterType<MyMockService>()
       .As<IMyService>()
       .WithMetadata("IsMock", true);

// Resolve conditionally based on configuration.
var container = builder.Build();
using(var scope = container.BeginLifetimeScope(b =>
{
    // Use a lambda to pick the correct service based on a condition.
    b.Register(c =>
    {
        bool useMock = // read from configuration;
        var services = c.Resolve<IEnumerable<Meta<IMyService>>>();
        return services.First(s => (bool)s.Metadata["IsMock"] == useMock).Value;
    }).As<IMyService>();
}))
{
    var myService = scope.Resolve<IMyService>();
}
```

**Named Registrations:**
Alternatively, some containers allow you to register named implementations and then resolve based on a key or condition.

**Using Factory Delegates
Dynamic Resolution:**
Instead of directly injecting an instance, inject a delegate (Func<IMyService>) that encapsulates the logic to choose the appropriate implementation at runtime.

```typescript
services.AddTransient<MyRealService>();
services.AddTransient<MyMockService>();
services.AddTransient<Func<bool, IMyService>>(serviceProvider => (useMock) =>
{
    return useMock 
        ? serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<MyMockService>() 
        : serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<MyRealService>();
});
```

The consumer can then use the delegate to resolve the appropriate service dynamically:

```typescript
public class Consumer
{
    private readonly Func<bool, IMyService> _serviceFactory;
    
    public Consumer(Func<bool, IMyService> serviceFactory)
    {
        _serviceFactory = serviceFactory;
    }
    
    public void Execute(bool useMock)
    {
        var service = _serviceFactory(useMock);
        service.PerformOperation();
    }
}
```

**3. Memory and Performance Considerations
Impact on Memory Usage
Registration Overhead:**
Conditional registration might involve registering multiple implementations, which can increase the container's memory footprint slightly. However, this overhead is typically minimal compared to the overall benefits.
**
Lazy Instantiation:**
Since DI containers generally instantiate services on demand, registering multiple implementations does not mean all instances are created immediately; only the resolved implementation is instantiated.

**Performance Considerations
Resolution Time:**
The conditional logic itself may add a small performance cost during service resolution, especially if it involves scanning metadata or executing factory delegates. For most applications, this cost is negligible.

**Caching and Scoping:**
Proper use of service lifetimes (transient, scoped, singleton) can mitigate potential performance issues by ensuring that objects are reused where appropriate.
