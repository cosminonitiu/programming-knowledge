Understanding how memory is allocated and managed is critical for writing high-performance .NET applications. This topic covers the differences between stack and heap allocation, as well as how memory fragmentation can impact performance.

## 1. Stack vs. Heap Allocation

### **Stack Allocation:**
- **Definition:**  
  The stack is a region of memory that stores value types and local variables. It follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Fast Allocation/Deallocation:**  
    Memory is allocated and released automatically as functions are called and return.
  - **Limited Size:**  
    The stack is typically much smaller than the heap, and deep recursion or large local variables can cause a stack overflow.
  - **Deterministic Lifetime:**  
    Variables on the stack are automatically cleaned up when they go out of scope.
- **Example:**  
  In C#, simple value types (like `int` or `struct`) declared within a method are stored on the stack.
  ```typescript
  public void ProcessData()
  {
      int number = 42; // Allocated on the stack
      // number is automatically deallocated when the method returns
  }
  ```

  **Heap Allocation:
Definition:**
The heap is a larger pool of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where reference types and objects are stored.

**Characteristics:

Dynamic Allocation:**
Memory is allocated at runtime using the new keyword, and objects remain in memory until they are no longer referenced and garbage collected.

**Garbage Collection:**
The CLRâ€™s garbage collector periodically reclaims memory from objects on the heap that are no longer in use.

**Variable Lifetime:**
Objects on the heap can have longer lifetimes and may be shared across different parts of the application.

Example:
In C#, objects and arrays are allocated on the heap.

```typescript
public class DataProcessor
{
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        var numbers = new int[100]; // Allocated on the heap
        // 'numbers' will be eligible for garbage collection when there are no references to it
    }
}
```

**2. Memory Fragmentation and Performance Implications
Memory Fragmentation:
Definition:**
Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate large blocks of memory even if sufficient total free memory exists.

**Types:**
**
External Fragmentation:**
Occurs in the heap when free blocks are scattered between allocated memory.

**Internal Fragmentation:**
Occurs when allocated memory contains unused space due to fixed block sizes or alignment requirements.

**Performance Implications:
Allocation Efficiency:**
Fragmentation can slow down allocation if the runtime must search for suitably sized free blocks.

**Garbage Collection Overhead:**
Fragmented memory may require more frequent or longer garbage collection cycles, impacting application performance.

**Large Object Heap (LOH):**
The LOH, used for objects larger than approximately 85 KB, is particularly prone to fragmentation. Because the LOH is collected less frequently, fragmentation in this area can lead to inefficient memory use and increased memory pressure.

**Mitigation Strategies:
Object Pooling:**
Reuse large objects or arrays to reduce frequent allocations and deallocations.

**Optimize Allocation Patterns:**
Avoid allocating many small objects in rapid succession that could lead to fragmentation.

**Monitor Memory Usage:**
Use profiling tools (e.g., PerfView, Visual Studio Profiler) to track memory allocation and fragmentation, and adjust your allocation strategies accordingly.
