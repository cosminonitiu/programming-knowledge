The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles can be applied in the context of object-oriented programming, and they align well with creating high-quality systems in .NET.

- **S**: **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP)
    
    A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
    
- **O**: **Open/Closed Principle** (OCP)
    
    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages polymorphism and inheritance to extend functionality.
    
- **L**: **Liskov Substitution Principle** (LSP)
    
    Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
    
- **I**: **Interface Segregation Principle** (ISP)
    
    Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Create smaller, more specific interfaces rather than a large, all-encompassing one.
    
- **D**: **Dependency Inversion Principle** (DIP)
    
    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
