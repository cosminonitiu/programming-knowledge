Extension methods in C# allow developers to add new methods to existing types without modifying, deriving from, or recompiling the original types. They are static methods defined in a static class, but called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. Extension methods provide a flexible way to extend the functionality of a class or interface.

To use extension methods, the static class containing the extension method must be in scope, which usually requires a using directive for the namespace of the class.

Advantages of using extension methods include:

Enhancing the functionality of third-party libraries or built-in .NET types without access to the original source code.
Keeping code cleaner and more readable by encapsulating complex operations into methods.
Facilitating a fluent interface style of coding, which can make code more expressive.

Here is a simple example demonstrating how to define and use an extension method:

```typescript
using System;

namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class StringExtensions
    {
        // Extension method for the String class
        public static string ToPascalCase(this string input)
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(input))
                return input;

            string[] words = input.Split(new char[] { ' ', '-' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
            for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
            {
                words[i] = char.ToUpper(words[i][0]) + words[i].Substring(1).ToLower();
            }
            return string.Join("", words);
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string title = "the quick-brown fox";
        string pascalCaseTitle = title.ToPascalCase();
        Console.WriteLine(pascalCaseTitle); // Outputs: TheQuickBrownFox
    }
}
```

In this example, ToPascalCase is an extension method defined for the String class. It converts a given string to Pascal case format. To use this extension method, simply call it on a string instance, as shown in the Main method. This demonstrates how extension methods can add useful functionality to existing types in a clean and natural syntax.

Extension methods are a powerful feature for extending the capabilities of types, especially when direct modifications to the class are not possible or desirable.
