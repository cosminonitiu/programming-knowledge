## 1. HashSet<T>

### Overview
- **Definition:**  
  `HashSet<T>` is a collection that stores unique elements without any particular order. It is optimized for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.
  
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - **Uniqueness:** Automatically prevents duplicate entries.
  - **Unordered:** Elements are stored in no guaranteed order.
  - **Performance:** Average-case O(1) time complexity for add, remove, and lookup operations.

### Internal Implementation
- **Hash Table Structure:**  
  - **Buckets and Slots:**  
    Internally, `HashSet<T>` uses a hash table where elements are assigned to buckets based on their hash code. Each bucket holds one or more elements that share the same hash code modulo the bucket count.
  - **Hash Function:**  
    Uses the `GetHashCode()` method of type `T` (or a custom comparer) to compute the hash code and determine the appropriate bucket.
  - **Collision Resolution:**  
    In case of collisions (different elements with the same hash bucket), the implementation uses linear probing or chaining to resolve conflicts.
  - **Resizing:**  
    The hash table dynamically resizes when the load factor exceeds a threshold, ensuring that performance remains optimal. This resizing operation has a cost of O(n) but occurs infrequently, so the amortized cost remains O(1).

### Use Cases
- **Fast Lookups:**  
  Ideal for scenarios requiring frequent membership tests, such as checking for duplicates or managing collections of unique items.
- **Set Operations:**  
  Efficiently supports union, intersection, and difference operations on sets.
- **Caching:**  
  Commonly used for caching and maintaining a list of processed items.

### Best Practices
- **Custom Comparers:**  
  If the default hash function is not suitable, provide a custom `IEqualityComparer<T>` to improve distribution and performance.
- **Pre-sizing:**  
  When possible, initialize the `HashSet<T>` with an estimated capacity to reduce the number of resizes.
  ```typescript
  var hashSet = new HashSet<int>(100);
  ```

**Minimize Expensive Operations:**
Avoid operations that force the entire collection to rehash, such as clearing a large set repeatedly.

**2. SortedSet<T>
Overview**
Definition:
SortedSet<T> is a collection that stores unique elements in sorted order. It is implemented as a balanced binary search tree (typically a red-black tree).

**Key Characteristics:**

**Ordered Collection:**
Automatically maintains elements in sorted order.

**Performance:**
Provides O(log n) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
**
Usefulness:**
Ideal when ordered iteration or range queries are required.

**Internal Implementation**
**Balanced Binary Search Tree (Red-Black Tree):**

**Structure:**
Elements are stored as nodes in a tree that maintains balance using red-black properties. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing predictable performance.

**Sorted Order:**
The in-order traversal of the tree yields the elements in ascending order.

**Custom Comparers:**
By default, SortedSet<T> uses the default comparer for type T. You can also supply a custom IComparer<T> to determine the sort order.

**Use Cases
Ordered Iteration:**
When you need to iterate over a set of elements in a specific, sorted order.

**Range Queries:**
Efficiently retrieve subsets of data that fall within a certain range.

**Sorted Data Requirements:**
Applications like leaderboards or scheduling systems where order matters.

**Best Practices
Custom Sorting:**
Implement a custom comparer if the natural order of type T does not meet your requirements.

**Consider Data Size:**
SortedSet<T> has a higher per-element overhead compared to HashSet<T> due to tree pointers, so it is best used for collections where order is essential.

**Use for Range Operations:**
Leverage its ability to perform range queries efficiently when the problem domain requires sorted data.
