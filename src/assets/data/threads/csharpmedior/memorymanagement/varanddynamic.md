Both var and dynamic are used for variable declaration in C#, but they serve different purposes and behave differently at compile time and runtime. Below is a detailed explanation of their differences, use cases, and examples.

**1. var Keyword**
Definition: The var keyword is used to declare implicitly typed variables. The type of the variable is inferred by the compiler based on the assigned value.
Purpose: Simplify code by reducing redundancy, especially with complex types.

Key Features:
Statically Typed: The type is determined at compile time and cannot change.
Type Safety: The compiler enforces type checking.
Requires Initialization: The variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.

**2. dynamic Keyword**
Definition: The dynamic keyword is used to declare variables whose type is resolved at runtime. The type can change during execution.
Purpose: Enable late binding and interoperability with dynamic languages or COM objects.

Key Features:
Dynamically Typed: The type is resolved at runtime.
No Compile-Time Type Checking: Errors related to type mismatches are caught at runtime.
Flexibility: Allows calling methods or accessing properties that are not known at compile time.
