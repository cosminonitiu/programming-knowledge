## What is JIT Compilation?

### Overview:
- **Definition:**  
  JIT compilation occurs in the browser at runtime. When your Angular app loads, the Angular compiler is shipped with your application. It then compiles your templates and components on the fly as the app runs.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - **Fast Development:**  
    JIT provides rapid development cycles with a fast rebuild time and dynamic compilation, making it easier to debug and iterate.
  - **Flexibility:**  
    Since compilation happens in the browser, you can use dynamic templates and rely less on a build step during development.

- **Drawbacks:**  
  - **Performance Overhead:**  
    Compiling in the browser adds extra load time, which can slow down the initial rendering of your app.
  - **Larger Bundle Sizes:**  
    The Angular compiler must be included in the bundle, increasing its size.
  - **Security Concerns:**  
    Runtime compilation can potentially expose your application to template injection risks if not managed carefully.

## What is AOT Compilation?

### Overview:
- **Definition:**  
  AOT compilation occurs during the build process. Angular’s compiler runs at build time, translating your Angular components and HTML templates into highly optimized JavaScript code. This compiled code is what gets shipped to the browser.
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - **Faster Startup:**  
    Since there’s no need to compile templates in the browser, the app boots up faster.
  - **Smaller Bundles:**  
    The Angular compiler is not included in the final bundle, reducing its size.
  - **Improved Security:**  
    Precompiled templates reduce the risk of injection attacks.
  - **Error Detection:**  
    Many template errors are caught at build time rather than at runtime, leading to more robust code.

- **Drawbacks:**  
  - **Longer Build Times:**  
    The AOT process adds extra time during the build phase.
  - **Less Flexibility:**  
    Since templates are precompiled, dynamic template creation is limited.

## When to Use Each

- **Development:**  
  During development, JIT compilation is often preferred due to its flexibility and faster incremental builds. It allows for a rapid development cycle with live reloads and easier debugging.
  
- **Production:**  
  For production builds, AOT is strongly recommended. The benefits of faster startup times, smaller bundles, and pre-runtime error checking outweigh the longer build times. Angular CLI uses AOT by default when building for production (`ng build --prod`).

## How They Impact Change Detection and Performance

- **JIT:**  
  The application must compile templates at runtime, meaning change detection is initiated only after compilation is complete. However, the compilation process itself can delay the initial change detection cycle.
  
- **AOT:**  
  With templates precompiled, change detection and rendering happen immediately with optimized code. This results in better runtime performance and more predictable behavior.
