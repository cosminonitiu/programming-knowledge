Decorators are a fundamental concept in TypeScript, and because Angular heavily relies on TypeScript, decorators have become an important element of Angular as well.

Decorators are methods or design patterns that are labeled with a prefixed @ symbol and preceded by a class, method, or property. They enable the modification of a service, directive, or filter before it is utilized. A decorator, in essence, provides configuration metadata that specifies how a component, class, or method should be processed, constructed, and used at runtime. Angular includes a number of decorators which attach various types of metadata to classes, allowing the system to understand what all these classes signify and how they should function.

**Types of decorators:
**
**Method Decorato**r: Method decorators, as the name implies, are used to add functionality to the methods defined within our class.
**Class Decorator**: Class Decorators are the highest-level decorators that determine the purpose of the classes. They indicate to Angular that a specific class is a component or module. And the decorator enables us to declare this effect without having to write any code within the class.
**Parameter Decorator**: The arguments of your class constructors are decorated using parameter decorators.
**Property Decorator**: These are the second most popular types of decorators. They enable us to enhance some of the properties in our classes.

### Class Decorators
- **Purpose:**  
  Identify a class as a particular Angular construct and attach configuration metadata.
  
- **Common Examples:**  
  - **@Component:**  
    Declares a class as an Angular component and provides its template, styles, and other configuration.

```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-hello',
      template: `<h1>Hello, Angular!</h1>`,
      styles: [`h1 { color: blue; }`]
    })
    export class HelloComponent {}
```

- **@NgModule:**  
    Defines an Angular module, specifying declarations, imports, providers, and bootstrap components.

```typescript
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

    @NgModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent],
      imports: [BrowserModule],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule {}
```

- **@Injectable:**  
    Marks a class as available to be injected as a dependency.

```typescript
    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class DataService {
      // Service logic here
    }
```

### Property Decorators
- **Purpose:**  
  Modify or add metadata to properties within a class.
  
- **Common Examples:**  
  - **@Input:**  
    Marks a property as an input binding, allowing data to flow from a parent component.

```typescript
    import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-user',
      template: `<p>User: {{ name }}</p>`
    })
    export class UserComponent {
      @Input() name: string;
    }
```

- **@Output:**  
    Marks a property as an output binding using an `EventEmitter` to emit events.

```typescript
    import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-button',
      template: `<button (click)="handleClick()">Click Me</button>`
    })
    export class ButtonComponent {
      @Output() clicked = new EventEmitter<void>();

      handleClick() {
        this.clicked.emit();
      }
    }
```

**Method Decorators
Overview:**
Method decorators are applied to methods within a class to extend or modify their behavior. In Angular, while method decorators are less common than class or property decorators, they can be used to add logging, performance monitoring, or other cross-cutting concerns to methods.

**Usage Considerations:**
Although Angular does not include many built-in method decorators, you can create custom decorators to intercept method calls.

Example of a Custom Method Decorator:

```typescript
function LogExecutionTime(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    const start = performance.now();
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    const end = performance.now();
    console.log(`${propertyKey} executed in ${end - start} ms`);
    return result;
  };
  return descriptor;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-demo',
  template: `<p>Check the console for method execution time.</p>`
})
export class DemoComponent {
  @LogExecutionTime
  computeHeavyTask() {
    // Simulate heavy computation
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {}
    return 'done';
  }
}
```

**Parameter Decorators
Overview:**
Parameter decorators are used to add metadata to the parameters of a class constructor. Angular uses these decorators to inject dependencies.

Common Example:

@Inject: Specifies a custom provider token to be used when injecting a dependency.

Example:
```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-doc-viewer',
  template: `<p>Check the document title in the console.</p>`
})
export class DocViewerComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(DOCUMENT) private document: Document) {
    console.log('Document title:', this.document.title);
  }
}
```

**3. How Angular Uses Decorators**
**Compilation and Metadata Generation:**
During the build process, Angular reads the metadata provided by decorators. This metadata informs the Angular compiler about component templates, dependency injection configurations, and more.

**Runtime Behavior:**
Decorators influence how Angular instantiates components and services, attaches event listeners, and performs change detection.

**Framework Integration:**
Decorators are integral to Angular’s architecture—they provide a declarative way to define what your classes are and how they should be used, reducing boilerplate and improving code clarity.

**4. Best Practices
Keep Decorator Metadata Concise:**
Only include necessary metadata to avoid overcomplicating your configuration.

**Use Built-In Decorators:**
Leverage Angular’s built-in decorators (@Component, @NgModule, @Injectable, etc.) to ensure compatibility and maintainability.

**Custom Decorators:**
When creating custom decorators (e.g., for logging or performance), ensure they remain pure and do not introduce side effects that could affect component behavior.

**Consistent Naming Conventions:**
Follow Angular style guides for naming and structuring your decorators, inputs, outputs, and injection tokens.
