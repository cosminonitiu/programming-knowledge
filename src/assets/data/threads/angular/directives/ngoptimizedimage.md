## Getting started with NgOptimizedImage  
The NgOptimizedImage directive makes it easy to adopt performance best practices for loading images.  
<br>

The directive ensures that the loading of the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) image is prioritized by:  
<br>

Automatically setting the fetchpriority attribute on the <img> tag  
Lazy loading other images by default  
Automatically generating a preconnect link tag in the document head  
Automatically generating a srcset attribute  
Generating a preload hint if app is using SSR  
<br>

In addition to optimizing the loading of the LCP image, NgOptimizedImage enforces a number of image best practices, such as:  
<br>

Using image CDN URLs to apply image optimizations  
Preventing layout shift by requiring width and height  
Warning if width or height have been set incorrectly  
Warning if the image will be visually distorted when rendered  
<br>

Note: Although the NgOptimizedImage directive was made a stable feature in Angular version 15, it has been backported and is available as a stable feature in versions 13.4.0 and 14.3.0 as well.  
<br>

## Getting Started  
Import NgOptimizedImage directive from @angular/common:  
```typescript
import { NgOptimizedImage } from '@angular/common'
```  
and include it into the imports array of a standalone component or an NgModule:  
```typescript
imports: [
  NgOptimizedImage,
  // ...
],
```  
<br>

### (Optional) Set up a Loader  
An image loader is not required in order to use NgOptimizedImage, but using one with an image CDN enables powerful performance features, including automatic srcsets for your images.  
A brief guide for setting up a loader can be found in the Configuring an Image Loader section at the end of this page.  
To activate the NgOptimizedImage directive, replace your image's src attribute with ngSrc  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg">
```  
If you're using a built-in third-party loader, make sure to omit the base URL path from src, as that will be prepended automatically by the loader.  
<br>

### Mark images as priority  
Always mark the LCP image on your page as priority to prioritize its loading.  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" priority>
```  
Marking an image as priority applies the following optimizations:  
<br>

Sets fetchpriority=high (read more about priority hints here)  
Sets loading=eager (read more about native lazy loading here)  
Automatically generates a preload link element if rendering on the server.  
<br>

Angular displays a warning during development if the LCP element is an image that does not have the priority attribute. A pageâ€™s LCP element can vary based on a number of factors - such as the dimensions of a user's screen, so a page may have multiple images that should be marked priority. See CSS for Web Vitals for more details.  
<br>

### Include Width and Height  
In order to prevent image-related layout shifts, NgOptimizedImage requires that you specify a height and width for your image, as follows:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200">
```  
For responsive images (images which you've styled to grow and shrink relative to the viewport), the width and height attributes should be the intrinsic size of the image file. For responsive images it's also important to set a value for sizes.  

For fixed size images, the width and height attributes should reflect the desired rendered size of the image. The aspect ratio of these attributes should always match the intrinsic aspect ratio of the image.  

Note: If you don't know the size of your images, consider using "fill mode" to inherit the size of the parent container, as described below.  
<br>

## Using fill mode  
In cases where you want to have an image fill a containing element, you can use the fill attribute. This is often useful when you want to achieve a "background image" behavior. It can also be helpful when you don't know the exact width and height of your image, but you do have a parent container with a known size that you'd like to fit your image into (see "object-fit" below).  
<br>

When you add the fill attribute to your image, you do not need and should not include a width and height, as in this example:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" fill>
```  
You can use the object-fit CSS property to change how the image will fill its container. If you style your image with object-fit: "contain", the image will maintain its aspect ratio and be "letterboxed" to fit the element. If you set object-fit: "cover", the element will retain its aspect ratio, fully fill the element, and some content may be "cropped" off.  
<br>

You can also style your image with the object-position property to adjust its position within its containing element.  
<br>

### How to migrate your background image  
Here's a simple step-by-step process for migrating from background-image to NgOptimizedImage. For these steps, we'll refer to the element that has an image background as the "containing element":  
<br>

Remove the background-image style from the containing element.  
Ensure that the containing element has position: "relative", position: "fixed", or position: "absolute".  
Create a new image element as a child of the containing element, using ngSrc to enable the NgOptimizedImage directive.  
Give that element the fill attribute. Do not include a height and width.  
If you believe this image might be your LCP element, add the priority attribute to the image element.  
<br>

## Using Placeholders
### Automatic placeholders  
NgOptimizedImage can display an automatic low-resolution placeholder for your image if you're using a CDN or image host that provides automatic image resizing. Take advantage of this feature by adding the placeholder attribute to your image:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" placeholder>
```  
Adding this attribute automatically requests a second, smaller version of the image using your specified image loader. This small image will be applied as a background-image style with a CSS blur while your image loads. If no image loader is provided, no placeholder image can be generated and an error will be thrown.  
<br>

The default size for generated placeholders is 30px wide. You can change this size by specifying a pixel value in the IMAGE_CONFIG provider, as seen below:  
```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_CONFIG,
    useValue: {
      placeholderResolution: 40
    }
  },
],
```  
If you want sharp edges around your blurred placeholder, you can wrap your image in a containing <div> with the overflow: hidden style. As long as the <div> is the same size as the image (such as by using the width: fit-content style), the "fuzzy edges" of the placeholder will be hidden.  
<br>

### Data URL placeholders  
You can also specify a placeholder using a base64 data URL without an image loader. The data url format is data:image/[imagetype];[data], where [imagetype] is the image format, just as png, and [data] is a base64 encoding of the image. That encoding can be done using the command line or in JavaScript. For specific commands, see the MDN documentation. An example of a data URL placeholder with truncated data is shown below:  
```typescript
<img 
  ngSrc="cat.jpg" 
  width="400" 
  height="200" 
  placeholder="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."
/>
```  
However, large data URLs increase the size of your Angular bundles and slow down page load. If you cannot use an image loader, the Angular team recommends keeping base64 placeholder images smaller than 4KB and using them exclusively on critical images. In addition to decreasing placeholder dimensions, consider changing image formats or parameters used when saving images. At very low resolutions, these parameters can have a large effect on file size.  
<br>

### Non-blurred placeholders  
By default, NgOptimizedImage applies a CSS blur effect to image placeholders. To render a placeholder without blur, provide a placeholderConfig argument with an object that includes the blur property, set to false. For example:  
```typescript
<img 
  ngSrc="cat.jpg" 
  width="400" 
  height="200" 
  placeholder 
  [placeholderConfig]="{blur: false}"
/>
```  
<br>

### Adjusting image styling  
Depending on the image's styling, adding width and height attributes may cause the image to render differently. NgOptimizedImage warns you if your image styling renders the image at a distorted aspect ratio.  
<br>

You can typically fix this by adding height: auto or width: auto to your image styles. If the width and height attribute on the image are preventing you from sizing the image the way you want with CSS, consider using fill mode instead, and styling the image's parent element.  
<br>

## Performance Features  
NgOptimizedImage includes a number of features designed to improve loading performance in your app. These features are described in this section.  
<br>

### Add resource hints  
A preconnect resource hint for your image origin ensures that the LCP image loads as quickly as possible.  
<br>

Preconnect links are automatically generated for domains provided as an argument to a loader. If an image origin cannot be automatically identified, and no preconnect link is detected for the LCP image, NgOptimizedImage will warn during development. In that case, you should manually add a resource hint to index.html. Within the <head> of the document, add a link tag with rel="preconnect", as shown below:  
```typescript
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://my.cdn.origin" />
```  
To disable preconnect warnings, inject the PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST token:  
```typescript
providers: [
  {provide: PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST, useValue: 'https://your-domain.com'}
],
```  
<br>

## Request images at the correct size with automatic srcset  
Defining a srcset attribute ensures that the browser requests an image at the right size for your user's viewport, so it doesn't waste time downloading an image that's too large. NgOptimizedImage generates an appropriate srcset for the image, based on the presence and value of the sizes attribute on the image tag.  
<br>

### Fixed-size images  
If your image should be "fixed" in size (i.e. the same size across devices, except for pixel density), there is no need to set a sizes attribute. A srcset can be generated automatically from the image's width and height attributes with no further input required.  
```typescript
<img ... srcset="image-400w.jpg 1x, image-800w.jpg 2x">
```  
<br>

### Responsive images  
If your image should be responsive (i.e. grow and shrink according to viewport size), then you will need to define a sizes attribute to generate the srcset.  
<br>

If you haven't used sizes before, a good place to start is to set it based on viewport width. For example, if your CSS causes the image to fill 100% of viewport width, set sizes to 100vw and the browser will select the image in the srcset that is closest to the viewport width (after accounting for pixel density). If your image is only likely to take up half the screen (ex: in a sidebar), set sizes to 50vw to ensure the browser selects a smaller image. And so on.  
<br>

Note that NgOptimizedImage automatically prepends "auto" to the provided sizes value. This is an optimization that increases the accuracy of srcset selection on browsers which support sizes="auto", and is ignored by browsers which do not.  
<br>

By default, the responsive breakpoints are:  
```[16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840]```  
If you would like to customize these breakpoints, you can do so using the IMAGE_CONFIG provider:  
```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_CONFIG,
    useValue: {
      breakpoints: [16, 48, 96, 128, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920]
    }
  },
],
```  
If you would like to manually define a srcset attribute, you can provide your own using the ngSrcset attribute:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w">
```  
If the ngSrcset attribute is present, NgOptimizedImage generates and sets the srcset based on the sizes included. Do not include image file names in ngSrcset - the directive infers this information from ngSrc. The directive supports both width descriptors (e.g. 100w) and density descriptors (e.g. 1x).  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w" sizes="50vw">
```  
<br>

### Disabling automatic srcset generation  
To disable srcset generation for a single image, you can add the disableOptimizedSrcset attribute on the image:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="about.jpg" disableOptimizedSrcset>
```  
<br>

### Disabling image lazy loading

For responsive images (images which you've styled to grow and shrink relative to the viewport), the width and height attributes should be the intrinsic size of the image file. For responsive images it's also important to set a value for sizes.

For fixed size images, the width and height attributes should reflect the desired rendered size of the image. The aspect ratio of these attributes should always match the intrinsic aspect ratio of the image.

Note: If you don't know the size of your images, consider using "fill mode" to inherit the size of the parent container, as described below.

Using fill mode
In cases where you want to have an image fill a containing element, you can use the fill attribute. This is often useful when you want to achieve a "background image" behavior. It can also be helpful when you don't know the exact width and height of your image, but you do have a parent container with a known size that you'd like to fit your image into (see "object-fit" below).

When you add the fill attribute to your image, you do not need and should not include a width and height, as in this example:

If you set object-fit: "cover", the element will retain its aspect ratio, fully fill the element, and some content may be "cropped" off.

See visual examples of the above at the MDN object-fit documentation.

You can also style your image with the object-position property to adjust its position within its containing element.

IMPORTANT: For the "fill" image to render properly, its parent element must be styled with position: "relative", position: "fixed", or position: "absolute".

How to migrate your background image
Here's a simple step-by-step process for migrating from background-image to NgOptimizedImage. For these steps, we'll refer to the element that has an image background as the "containing element":

Remove the background-image style from the containing element.
Ensure that the containing element has position: "relative", position: "fixed", or position: "absolute".
Create a new image element as a child of the containing element, using ngSrc to enable the NgOptimizedImage directive.
Give that element the fill attribute. Do not include a height and width.
If you believe this image might be your LCP element, add the priority attribute to the image element.
You can adjust how the background image fills the container as described in the Using fill mode section.

Using placeholders
Automatic placeholders
NgOptimizedImage can display an automatic low-resolution placeholder for your image if you're using a CDN or image host that provides automatic image resizing. Take advantage of this feature by adding the placeholder attribute to your image:

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" placeholder>
check
Adding this attribute automatically requests a second, smaller version of the image using your specified image loader. This small image will be applied as a background-image style with a CSS blur while your image loads.

If the width and height attribute on the image are preventing you from sizing the image the way you want with CSS, consider using fill mode instead, and styling the image's parent element.

Performance Features
NgOptimizedImage includes a number of features designed to improve loading performance in your app. These features are described in this section.

Add resource hints
A preconnect resource hint for your image origin ensures that the LCP image loads as quickly as possible.

Preconnect links are automatically generated for domains provided as an argument to a loader. If an image origin cannot be automatically identified, and no preconnect link is detected for the LCP image, NgOptimizedImage will warn during development. In that case, you should manually add a resource hint to index.html. Within the <head> of the document, add a link tag with rel="preconnect", as shown below:

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://my.cdn.origin" />
check
To disable preconnect warnings, inject the PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST token:

providers: [
  {provide: PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST, useValue: 'https://your-domain.com'}
],
check
See more information on automatic preconnect generation here.

Request images at the correct size with automatic srcset
Defining a srcset attribute ensures that the browser requests an image at the right size for your user's viewport, so it doesn't waste time downloading an image that's too large. NgOptimizedImage generates an appropriate srcset for the image, based on the presence and value of the sizes attribute on the image tag.

Fixed-size images
If your image should be "fixed" in size (i.e. the same size across devices, except for pixel density), there is no need to set a sizes attribute. A srcset can be generated automatically from the image's width and height attributes with no further input required.

Example srcset generated:

<img ... srcset="image-400w.jpg 1x, image-800w.jpg 2x">
check
Responsive images
If your image should be responsive (i.e. grow and shrink according to viewport size), then you will need to define a sizes attribute to generate the srcset.

If you haven't used sizes before, a good place to start is to set it based on viewport width. For example, if your CSS causes the image to fill 100% of viewport width, set sizes to 100vw and the browser will select the image in the srcset that is closest to the viewport width (after accounting for pixel density). If your image is only likely to take up half the screen (ex: in a sidebar), set sizes to 50vw to ensure the browser selects a smaller image. And so on.

If you find that the above does not cover your desired image behavior, see the documentation on advanced sizes values.

Note that NgOptimizedImage automatically prepends "auto" to the provided sizes value. This is an optimization that increases the accuracy of srcset selection on browsers which support sizes="auto", and is ignored by browsers which do not.

By default, the responsive breakpoints are:

[16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840]

If you would like to customize these breakpoints, you can do so using the IMAGE_CONFIG provider:

providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_CONFIG,
    useValue: {
      breakpoints: [16, 48, 96, 128, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920]
    }
  },
],
check
If you would like to manually define a srcset attribute, you can provide your own using the ngSrcset attribute:

<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w">
check
If the ngSrcset attribute is present, NgOptimizedImage generates and sets the srcset based on the sizes included. Do not include image file names in ngSrcset - the directive infers this information from ngSrc. The directive supports both width descriptors (e.g. 100w) and density descriptors (e.g. 1x).

<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w" sizes="50vw">
check
Disabling automatic srcset generation
To disable srcset generation for a single image, you can add the disableOptimizedSrcset attribute on the image:

<img ngSrc="about.jpg" disableOptimizedSrcset>
check
Disabling image lazy loading
By default, NgOptimizedImage sets loading=lazy for all images that are not marked priority. You can disable this behavior for non-priority images by setting the loading attribute. This attribute accepts values: eager, auto, and lazy.   
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" loading="eager">
```  
<br>

### Advanced 'sizes' values  
You may want to have images displayed at varying widths on differently-sized screens. A common example of this pattern is a grid- or column-based layout that renders a single column on mobile devices, and two columns on larger devices. You can capture this behavior in the sizes attribute, using a "media query" syntax, such as the following:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw">
```  
The sizes attribute in the above example says "I expect this image to be 100 percent of the screen width on devices under 768px wide. Otherwise, I expect it to be 50 percent of the screen width.  
<br>

## Configuring an image loader for NgOptimizedImage  
A "loader" is a function that generates an image transformation URL for a given image file. When appropriate, NgOptimizedImage sets the size, format, and image quality transformations for an image.  
NgOptimizedImage provides both a generic loader that applies no transformations, as well as loaders for various third-party image services. It also supports writing your own custom loader.  
<br>

### Built-in Loaders  
To use an existing loader for a third-party image service, add the provider factory for your chosen service to the providers array. In the example below, the Imgix loader is used:  
```typescript
providers: [
  provideImgixLoader('https://my.base.url/'),
],
```  
<br>

### Custom Loaders  
To use a custom loader, provide your loader function as a value for the IMAGE_LOADER DI token. In the example below, the custom loader function returns a URL starting with https://example.com that includes src and width as URL parameters.  
```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_LOADER,
    useValue: (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {
      return `https://example.com/images?src=${config.src}&width=${config.width}`;
    },
  },
],
```  
A loader function for the NgOptimizedImage directive takes an object with the ImageLoaderConfig type (from @angular/common) as its argument and returns the absolute URL of the image asset. The ImageLoaderConfig object contains the src property, and optional width and loaderParams properties.  
```typescript
const myCustomLoader = (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {
  let url = `https://example.com/images/${config.src}?`;
  let queryParams = [];
  if (config.width) {
    queryParams.push(`w=${config.width}`);
  }
  if (config.loaderParams?.roundedCorners) {
    queryParams.push('mask=corners&corner-radius=5');
  }
  return url + queryParams.join('&');
};
```  
<br>

### The loaderParams Property  
There is an additional attribute supported by the NgOptimizedImage directive, called loaderParams, which is specifically designed to support the use of custom loaders. The loaderParams attribute takes an object with any properties as a value, and does not do anything on its own. The data in loaderParams is added to the ImageLoaderConfig object passed to your custom loader, and can be used to control the behavior of the loader.  
A common use for loaderParams is controlling advanced image CDN features.  
<br>

### Example custom loader  
The following shows an example of a custom loader function. This example function concatenates src and width, and uses loaderParams to control a custom CDN feature for rounded corners:  
```typescript
<img ngSrc="profile.jpg" width="300" height="300" [loaderParams]="{roundedCorners: true}">
```  
Note that in the above example, we've invented the 'roundedCorners' property name to control a feature of our custom loader. We could then use this feature when creating an image, as follows:  
```typescript
providers: [
  provideImgixLoader('https://my.base.url/'),
],
```
