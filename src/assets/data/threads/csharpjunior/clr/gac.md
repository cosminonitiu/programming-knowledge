The Global Assembly Cache (GAC) is a machine-wide code cache for the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET Framework. It stores assemblies specifically designated to be shared by several applications on the computer. The GAC is used to store shared .NET assemblies that have strong names (which are unique identifiers consisting of a name, version number, culture information, and a public key token).

**Key Points about the GAC:
****
**Sharing Assemblies**: The GAC allows multiple applications to share the same library, reducing memory usage and ensuring consistency across applications that use common components.
**Strong Naming**: Only assemblies with strong names (signed with a public/private key pair) can be added to the GAC. Strong naming guarantees the uniqueness of the assembly's identity, allowing side-by-side hosting of different versions.
**Versioning**: The GAC supports side-by-side execution of different versions of the same assembly. This enables applications to specify and use the version of an assembly they were built with, even if newer versions are installed on the system.

**When to Use the GAC:**

**Shared Libraries**: Use the GAC for assemblies that need to be shared by multiple applications on the same machine. Common libraries or frameworks that are stable and versioned are good candidates.
**Side-by-Side Hosting**: When different versions of the same assembly need to be used by different applications on the same system, deploying these assemblies to the GAC can manage versioning complexities.
**Security**: Assemblies in the GAC are generally more secure, as only users with administrative privileges can add or remove assemblies. This control can prevent malicious code from being inadvertently added to the cache.

To add an assembly to the GAC, you can use the gacutil tool provided with the .NET Framework SDK:

**gacutil -i MyAssembly.dll**
This command installs MyAssembly.dll into the GAC.

Note: With the introduction of .NET Core and its focus on application-local deployment models, the GAC is less emphasized and is specific to the .NET Framework. .NET Core and .NET 5+ applications typically rely on package management systems like NuGet to handle dependencies and do not use the GAC.

The GAC plays a critical role in assembly sharing and versioning in the .NET Framework, facilitating the management of common libraries across applications on a single machine.
