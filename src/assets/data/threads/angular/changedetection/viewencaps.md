## 1. What is View Encapsulation?

- **Purpose:**  
  To scope CSS styles to a specific component, preventing style leakage and conflicts across the application.
- **Mechanism:**  
  Angular uses an internal mechanism to simulate Shadow DOM behavior or disable encapsulation altogether, depending on the configuration.
- **Available Strategies:**  
  Angular provides three main encapsulation modes via the `ViewEncapsulation` enum:
  - **Emulated:** (Default)  
    Angular emulates Shadow DOM by adding unique attributes to the component’s DOM elements and scoping styles using these attributes.
  - **None:**  
    No encapsulation is applied; styles defined in the component are global.
  - **ShadowDom:**  
    Uses the native Shadow DOM to encapsulate styles, leveraging the browser’s built-in encapsulation support.

## 2. Encapsulation Modes in Detail

### Emulated (Default)
- **How It Works:**  
  Angular processes the component’s CSS and adds unique attribute selectors (e.g., `_ngcontent-c0`) to both the DOM elements and the CSS rules. This effectively scopes styles to the component.
- **Pros:**  
  - Provides style isolation without relying on native Shadow DOM support.
  - Works in all browsers since it’s purely a build-time transformation.
- **Cons:**  
  - Not as strict as native Shadow DOM encapsulation.
  
```typescript
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<p>Emulated Encapsulation</p>`,
  styles: [`p { color: blue; }`],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated, // This is the default behavior.
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

None
How It Works:
When set to None, Angular does not apply any style encapsulation. The component’s styles are added globally.

Pros:

Useful for defining global styles or for prototyping.

Cons:

Increases risk of style conflicts and unintentional style overrides.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-no-encapsulation',
  template: `<p>No Encapsulation: styles are global!</p>`,
  styles: [`p { color: red; }`],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
})
export class NoEncapsulationComponent {}
```

**ShadowDom
How It Works:**
Angular uses the browser's native Shadow DOM APIs to encapsulate the component's styles. The component’s template is attached to a shadow root, and its styles are scoped natively.

Pros:

Provides true encapsulation as defined by the Web Components standard.

Ensures that styles do not leak out and external styles do not affect the component.

Cons:

Limited browser support compared to Emulated encapsulation (modern browsers support Shadow DOM, but older ones might not).

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-shadow-dom',
  template: `<p>Shadow DOM Encapsulation</p>`,
  styles: [`p { color: green; }`],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom,
})
export class ShadowDomComponent {}
```

**3. How It Affects Component Styles
Scoped Styling:**
In Emulated and ShadowDom modes, styles declared in a component are applied only to that component’s view. This prevents CSS conflicts across different parts of your application.
**
Global Styling:**
When using None, styles declared in the component will affect all elements that match the selectors, even outside the component.
**
Performance Considerations**:
Shadow DOM relies on native browser APIs and may perform better in environments where those are optimized, while Emulated encapsulation adds some overhead during the build process but ensures compatibility across browsers.
