In asynchronous programming with C#, when a method returns a Task or Task<T>, exceptions should be handled within the task to avoid unhandled exceptions that can crash the application. Exceptions thrown in a task are captured and placed on the returned task object. To handle these exceptions, you can use a try-catch block within the asynchronous method, or you can inspect the task after it has completed for any exceptions.

There are several approaches to handle exceptions in tasks:

**Inside the Asynchronous Method: Use a try-catch block inside the async method to catch exceptions directly.**

```typescript
public async Task PerformOperationAsync()
{
    try
    {
        // Async operation that may throw an exception
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
```

**When Awaiting the Task: Await the task inside a try-catch block to catch exceptions when the task is awaited.**

```typescript
try
{
    await PerformOperationAsync();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle exception
}
```

**Using Task.ContinueWith: Use the ContinueWith method to attach a continuation task that can handle exceptions.**

```typescript
PerformOperationAsync().ContinueWith(task =>
{
    if (task.Exception != null)
    {
        // Handle exception
        var exception = task.Exception.InnerException;
    }
}, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);
```

**Using Task.WhenAny: Useful for handling exceptions from multiple tasks.**
```typescript
var task = PerformOperationAsync();
await Task.WhenAny(task); // Wait for task to complete

if (task.IsFaulted)
{
    // Handle exception
    var exception = task.Exception.InnerException;
}
```

**Here is an example demonstrating handling exceptions for a method that returns a Task:**
```typescript
public async Task<int> DivideAsync(int numerator, int denominator)
{
    return await Task.Run(() =>
    {
        if (denominator == 0)
            throw new DivideByZeroException("Denominator cannot be zero.");

        return numerator / denominator;
    });
}

public async Task ExecuteAsync()
{
    try
    {
        int result = await DivideAsync(10, 0);
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    }
    catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

In this example, DivideAsync performs a division operation asynchronously and may throw a DivideByZeroException. The exception is handled in the ExecuteAsync method, demonstrating how to properly handle exceptions for tasks in asynchronous methods.

Handling exceptions in tasks is crucial for writing robust and error-resistant asynchronous C# applications, ensuring that your application can gracefully recover from errors encountered during asynchronous operations.
