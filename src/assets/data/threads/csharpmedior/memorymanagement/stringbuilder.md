In C#, string and StringBuilder are both used to work with text, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Understanding their differences is crucial for writing efficient and performant code.

**1. string in C#**
Definition: string is an immutable sequence of characters. Once a string object is created, it cannot be changed.
Immutability: Any operation that modifies a string (e.g., concatenation, replacement) creates a new string object.
Performance: Frequent modifications to a string can lead to performance issues due to the creation of multiple objects.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where the text does not change frequently (e.g., storing constants, displaying messages).

**2. StringBuilder in C#**
Definition: StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters. It allows in-place modifications without creating new objects.
Mutability: Operations like appending, inserting, or replacing characters modify the existing StringBuilder object.
Performance: More efficient than string for frequent modifications, as it avoids creating multiple objects.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios involving frequent text modifications (e.g., building large strings dynamically).
