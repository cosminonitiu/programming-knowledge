**Automatic View Updates
Template Bindings:**
When you bind a signal directly in an Angular template (e.g., {{ counter() }}), Angular automatically subscribes to changes. Unlike Observables that often require the AsyncPipe, signals update the view immediately upon change.
**
Fine-Grained Change Detection:**
Signals allow Angular to update only the parts of the DOM that depend on the changed value. This minimizes unnecessary re-renders and improves performance.

**Coexistence with Other Reactive Primitives
Interoperability:**
Signals can work alongside Observables and traditional component properties. They can serve as a local state container, while Observables can continue to manage asynchronous data streams.

**Migrating Existing Code:**
Angular signals provide a pathway for gradually refactoring complex RxJS-based state management into a simpler, signal-driven approach.
